<h3>Kanchanaburi</h3>

<h4>Transport:</h4>
<p>
    Nice to be back on a train from Thornburi Station in Bangkok to Kanchanaburi. We took the 1:55pm train and it only cost 100 Baht (£2.60) each. Not the most exciting ride to start, but you do see the shanty towns next to the tracks and the views get more beautiful later. Another very old train, apparently 80 years old like the Burmese trains and was the original Diesel replacement for the steam train! It was extremely hot on the train, the shutters were open but the stiflingly warm blast of air wasn’t helping, we were melting.

<h4>What we did:</h4>
<p>
    We did the typical touristic things in Kanchanaburi. We went to the ‘Thailand - Burmese Railway Center’, which was the museum about the ‘death railway’ built by prisoners of war and slaves in WWII. It was well worth the 140 Baht (£4) each, very informative with different displays, a video, and free tea/coffee at the end. We took the train for a day return to Nam Tok across the ‘Bridge over the River Kwai’ (interesting fact, it is actually not the Kwai river, but they renamed it after the film). The views were incredible teetering next to rivers, lush fields, mountains and the tracks took the original route over the wooden bridges built during that awful time. In Nam Tok, we walked the old tracks, swam in the waterfall there and had some lunch. We also visited the graves of the men who’d passed and paid our respects when we returned to Kanchanaburi.

    A different thing we decided to do, was go to a waterpark! It was so hot there, plus we were feeling a little down after all the hard hitting stuff, that we decided to go and play at ‘West Wonder Waterpark’. We had such a blast. There was no one else apart from a family of 5 there, so we had run of the place and all the slides. It was a great way to cool down and the views from the top of the slides were amazing too.

<h4>Accommodation:</h4>
<p>
    VN Guesthouse, on a giant floating raft on the river, is where we stayed. The views on the river were brilliant, and so were the sunsets. The karaoke next door was a bit annoying, and it was a bit strange being on a moving floor that would wobble a bit when you walk around, wouldn’t be good for anyone who gets sea sick! The food there was great, and the staff nice. For a night it cost us 470 Baht (£11) for a double room with bathroom, and was one of the cheapest places in the area as it’s expensive around there.
