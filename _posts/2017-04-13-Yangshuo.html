<h3>Yangshuo</h3>

<h4>Transport</h4>

    Instead of getting a train via Kowloon to Guangzhou again, we decided to try a different route, and so took the metro for 2 hours, all the way through Hong Kong into Shezhen, only getting off to walk through the border. Then we got on our first 30 minute bullet train to Guanzhou. Although the travel time itself wasn’t quicker, the border control was much quieter, and so it took around the same time, plus we saved a lot more money going this way as it only cost 51 Yuan (£5) each. The bullet train is amazing, smooth and quiet, picking up speeds of 300+km/h and it even has a screen telling you how fast it’s going.

<p>
    From Guanzhou, we took a 2 ½ hour bullet train for 111 Yuan (£13) each straight to Yangshuo station, which isn’t actually in Yangshou at all, it’s north of XingPing, about an hours drive from Yangshou village. As it was late at night when we arrived, we got a taxi to our guest house. We had also read that the buses finished at 6.30pm, but this wasn’t true as we saw one flying past us on our way to the village! Taxi cost us the most for this journey, 150 Yuan (£18) total, we were a bit annoyed, but the lady did take us straight to the door, 20 mins walk from the town centre and I don’t think we’d have found it in the night. Not a lot to say on the views as we were on the subway, then it was dark on the bullet trains.

<h3>Stuff we did</h3>

<p>
    Woke up in the morning to the sounds of birds and the views of the mountains outside our window. On our first day, we hired 2 mountain bikes from our guesthouse for 35 Yuan (£4) each. They were bright pink and even too small for Kat, so poor Jack was struggling! Regardless, they were brand new and carried us over rough terrain and HUGE hills, I moaned a lot (Kat, obviously Jack was fine as always), for over 50km. The ride was great though, we went along the smaller river exploring lots of little paths and on the way back rode through the hills past villages and farmers, who looked very bewildered as I don’t think many tourists are as stupid as us to go that way. 
</p>
<p>
    In the evening, we found a great restaurant in Yangshou called River Side (also a hotel). It did have a river view and restaurant service so was a little pricier than other places you can go, but it was well worth it, the food was delicious. Further south, the food has much more curry tastes and flavours (instead of just chillies) which we both love. 
</p>
<p>
    Our second day was spent Kayaking up and down the river. The owner of the guesthouse organised for us to go with a company for 220 Yuan (£23) each. We were expecting it to be a boring and slow tour, with lots of people and in very touristy areas. It wasn’t at all. We got picked up from the guest house, then picked up 2 other Canadians, and taken 22km South East to Shazi. Here we were given a little kayak each and allowed to just go 3km up the river and back. It wasn’t exactly white water rafting rapids, but it was so nice and chilled to just meander up and down the river at the pace we wanted to and really take in the green mountainous scenery in the sunshine. Apart from the little town we passed in the first kilometer, where people were fishing and washed their clothes in the river, it was so quiet with noone and no buildings around.

    For the final day, we walked the 20mins into the town to hire bikes from a little shop called ‘Bike Asia’. They cost much more for the day, 100 Yuan (£12) each, but were proper mountain bikes which actually fitted us, they even had an XL with a ridiculous stem extention for Jack. We cycled and got lost going to the ‘secret beach’ on the river, which wasn’t actually very nice, full of rubbish and charging boats flying past every 5 seconds, so if you go to Yangshou I wouldn’t bother! 
</p>
<p>
    Got some great street food for lunch in the main town; chilli tofu, curried spuds, and egg wrapped sausages on sticks (trust us, they’re a taste sensation). Fuelled for more cycling, we headed for Kat’s pilgramige to ‘Moon Hill’. We wanted to take the little tracks by the river again, but realised that they were only hiking ones and contained many steps, so just stuck to the main road route. Very sweaty as it was 27 degrees and humid (phone’s said ‘real feel 34 degrees’), we paid 14 Yuan (£1.80) each to voluntarily hike up an 800 steps steep hill. It was not so much fun, but definitely worth it once we reached the top to the crescent moon shaped hole in the hill. There were also some crazy people climbing said hole upsidedown (you can see them in the pictures), and we thought the walk up was hard enough!

<p>
    ‘The Stone Bridge - Home Sweet Home in the Valley’ (bit of a mouthful), was the name of the Guest House that we stayed in. It was 20 min walk out of the main town, we wanted to be more in the countryside, and had a great rating of 9 on booking.com, plus we got a 3 bed room (1 double + 1 single, that our backpacks slept on) for 252 Yuan (£29) for 3 nights for the two of us, so we went for it. 
</p>
<p>
    It was a great place to stay, the mountain bikes were good quality to rent (for normal sized people, not us giants), plus there were free commuter bikes that you could use. The Guest House was also run by Freida, and her little boy who provided endless entertainment, who was so lovely and helpful. You can also request dinners for 50 Yuan (£6) each in the morning, which we did for our final evening. They were plentiful home made dishes Freida made, and we ate with her and her son and another guest. 
</p>
<p>
    Freida had contacts to organise tours, and beers in the fridge that were a reasonable price (10 Yuan / £1.20) for the end of a hard day cycling! The bed was also comfortable, the room’s clean and everything was functional, she also had free VPN Wifi service, to get through the great firewall of China and actually use google/facebook/instagram again. If we ever went back we would definitely stay there again.
