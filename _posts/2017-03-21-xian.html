<h3>Xi'an</h3>

<h4>Transport</h4>

<p>
    To get to Xi'an, we booked with Emma our first 'hard sleeper' (3rd/bottom class) tickets. They cost us 200 Yuan (£24) for a middle bunk and 206 Yuan (£25) for a lower bunk to travel 13 hours overnight from Beijing. There are 66 beds in a carriage, and 6 beds in each open cabin (soft sleepers have lockable doors) with mini tables and fold out chairs along the walkway so you can sit if you manage to grab one early. 
</p>
<p>
    We didn't see a lot as it was overnight, and didn't get much sleep either as the guy on the 3rd tier bed, right next to Kat, was snoring so loudly. The beds are pretty hard too, should have guessed by the name, so it was good that we have our roll mats to put ontop of them. 
</p>
<p>
    I don't think the sheets get changed after every passenger either, the Chinese are not the best for hygiene, so would definitely recommend sleeping in your own lining/sleeping bag! No western toilets on these trains too, just a lovely hole in the ground like most places in China, with no loo roll or soap, so both those items have been essential to have with us at all times.

<h3>Stuff we did</h3>

    Xi'an is smaller than Beijing and seemed less affluent. Yet it's still massive and the smog was just as bad. The centre of the city is encompassed in a square city wall, built hunderds of years ago, which we learnt you can cycle on top off which is pretty cool. Annoyingly we didn't know about this, so there's a tip for others if you go!
</p>
<p>
    We ventured to the 'Goose Pagoda' on the first day. After trying to get a bus there and being shouted at in Chinese and told to get off the bus, we decided to walk. It took ages and we were tired, being stared at by everyone, and it wasn't really worth it. 
</p>
<p>
    Lots of people are taking photos of us, and videos and asking for pictures of themselves with us. It's so weird and we don't understsand why their doing it, will we end up on their mantlepieces like 'Hey look at this time I saw these tall foreigners'?!
</p>
<p>
    Second day was a rest day, where we finally caught up on some sleep, walked to the station to book our next train, and had a tradional chinese hot pot at the hostel with other travellers. It was great fun and we met some lovely people. After that, the staff and friends wanted us to teach them how to dance to YMCA, The Macorina and even the Pizza Hut song. It was hilarious, they loved it! Then after that the Karaoke, another Chinese favourite, happened. 
</p>
<p>
    Final day in Xi-an we went to see what we'd gone there for, the 'Terracotta Warriors'. It was incredible to see these warriors that had been built over 2000 years ago. The story is, that the emporer was crazy from taking mercury and in secrecy ordered 8,000 slaves to build him an army, before killing them all, that would protect him in the after-life. We learnt also about the farmer who found them, when digging to make a well, in 1974. Many of the warriors are broken and they are currently putting them back together. They estimate it will take over 70 years to restore them all.

<h4>Hostels</h4>

<p>
    We stayed for 3 nights at the 'So Young City Centre Hostel' for a ridiculously inexpensive £19 for the two of us in an extra large double room. The bed was actually wider than it was long, Kat used Jack as a measuring stick and we estimated 6ft wide X 6ft 6 long. 
</p>
<p>
    The rooms and corridors were more like a hotel than hostel. You could book in a 6 bed dorm but it was cheaper for us to get a double room. There was also the hostel 'Sky Bar' on the top floor, for food and drinks, with an amazing view of the city. They do things most nights for travellers to learn Chinese dishes and get to know other travellers too, like a hot pot night (which we did) and how to make your own dumplings night.
