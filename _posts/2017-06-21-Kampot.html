<h3>Kampot</h3>

    Our train left Phnom Penh at 3pm and arrived in Kampot at 7pm, it only cost us $6 each (apparently buses are $7). So pleased to be on a train; the seats are more comfortable, you can walk around, there’s a toilet, the scenery is better, there’s air-con, there was WiFi and plug sockets, Jack was very happy! 
</p>
<p>   
    Leaving the city the train has to go super slow as it’s only been back in service for 8 months. Some people don’t realise and still use the tracks to sit on and put their market stands on, so we saw some people running out the way when the horn was blown! The views were amazing though of the national park’s, rice fields and mountains.

    We arrived in Kampot, after Panch a friend from home, told us his uncle lives there and could advise us on things to do. Arriving at the hostel we quickly got in touch and found out he worked across the road from us. So after dropping our bags off and having a shower we headed over to say hi.

    Lucky for us, Paul said that we could use his Yamaha 250cc for the next couple of days which was so much fun. We spent our days there exploring; Bokor Hill, La Plantation Pepper Farm, lots of waterfalls and caves in Kampot and Kep, played on the homemade water park at Arcadia Backpackers ( a must do ), and drove around Kep national park. We really enjoyed it, even getting soaked on the bike and covered in mud driving through the dirt tracks was brilliant.

    Met a kiwi couple, Charlotte and Aiden, on the second night and chilled out with them, eating at one of the local noodle shops and heading to a roof top bar to have a drink. Early night though as we were exhausted after the two days on the bike
</p>
<p>
    On the last night we met Paul to offer a beer or two to say thanks and watched the moto gp and the f1. Few beers down the hatch a great ending to a great time in Kampot.

    We decided to stay at ‘Jacks’s Place’ in Kampot, after Adel’s recommendation. $2.50 for a big dorm bed with a fan, the place was clean and comfy, the food was good, and Jack (the Cambodian owner) was lovely and helpful. He also run’s his own tours and helps you to get buses anywhere and rent bikes/motorbikes if you want them. Although, Arcadia would have been so much fun to stay at, maybe another time.
