<h4>Distance: <span>152km</span> </h4>
<p>
    Hai Van Pass today, made even more famous of course by Top Gear. We rode the 160km on the bikes from Hue to Hoi An, along the coast, a small stretch of motorway, before the Hai Van Pass around the mountain, then more motorway along the coast past Da Nang to Hoi An.

    The pass is mainly for trucks and tourists on Motorbikes, rather than going through the tunnel on the motorway, and the road has recently been re-surfaced so it was super smooth. The views were pretty special of the turquoise sea and golden beaches, along the windy mountain pass. At the top, we had some lunch, classic Pho Bo, and climbed up and around the old fortress ruins.

    Arriving in Hoi An, there were so many places to stay we couldn’t decide where to head to, so just drove into the middle of the city and found a place over the bridge of the old town called ‘Hop Y Homestay’, a lovely family run guesthouse. As always in the cities, it was a bit more expensive, so a room with 2 double beds and bathroom was 500,000 Dong (£17) for 4 of us for 1 night with breakfast included. It was a lovely place to stay and the owner helped us out with where to go and what to do. She also recommended ‘Bill Ben’ for tailored suits, so that’s where we went the next day.

    After a night out to watch the Europa Final (Robert is a huge Aiax fan), the match didn’t start until 1.45am our time so we didn’t get in until about 4.30am! The sun was starting to rise and people were already selling and buying at the market stalls when we stumbled home. 
</p>
<p>
    When we eventually rose, we headed to Bill Ben Taylor’s to all get measured up for suits and dresses. They are truly amazing, after taking measurements and you’ve chosen your style, fabric and colours, they get to work making the suits and dresses and can be ready just 8 hours later. We went back the next day and got a few bits fixed here and there, then by the time we went back that evening they were perfect. A tailor made 3 piece suit with a shirt and 2 ties, plus 2 tailor made dresses, one silk and lace, cost us only 9,000,000 Dong, that’s about £300!
</p>
<p>
    In between suit and dress fittings, we headed to ‘My Son’ a 45 min drive away 2-up on the mopeds (Kat and Laura were over driving), to visit the ancient ruins. The ruins were very old and the detail on them was so intricate. Unfortunately many had been bombed in the war, there were still giant craters everywhere, there is reconstruction work going on still to remake some.
</p>
<p>
    In the evenings we headed to the night markets for food, eating local ‘Cao Lau’, big yellow noodles with vegetables, pork, crackling and a sweet sauce, yum yum. Bought a couple of souvenirs, saw all the beautiful lanterns and walked through the old town, you can see why so many expats stay here.
