<h3>Lake Bled + Vogel ski resort</h3>

<h4>Transport</h4>
<p>
    We have been using an app called <a href="http://www.goeuro.com">Go Euro</a> for most of our travel through Europe, however the app doesnt quite cover every country so finding a way into Slovenia was tricky, luckily a google search showed us that it was possible by taking a 3.5 hour bus to villach in Austria, followed by an hour train to Lesce-Bled then a 10 minute bus to Bled. We have found out afterwards that the best way to find trains is by using the <a href="http://www.interrail.eu">Inter Rail</a> website to find trains.
</p>
<p>
    The double decker bus this time was with a company called OBB, and seen us going through the flat vineyards of Italy followed by the mountains and rivers going north into Austria. The Train was even more Beautiful with scenary of snow, trees and mountainns on an old slow train

<h4>Exporing</h4>
<p>
    Bled is most definately our kind of place, the great outdoors and plenty of activities to do. During the winter its also nice and quiet however in the summer months we have been told that the population of the town can almost quadrouple with tourists. 
</p>

    We spent most of our time Hiking around the Lake, exploring viewpoints ( and sketchy caves / climbing rocks ) with Alex and Heather who we met at the Hostel. 7 of us hired bikes for the day from the Hostel for only 5euros and cycled to the Gorge which is part of the National Park 6km away. Unfortunately the gorge was closed due to logging, but we still got to see part of it and a stunning waterfall with the clearest water, it lookked so tempting to just dive in

    On Valentines day, we also went Skiing in Vogel, the largest ski resort in slovenia, with only 16 slopes we skied the whole resort in 2 hours but the conditions were great and the sun was shining we didnt care too much about doing the same runs over. Vogel also offers the sketchest 1 man lift i have ever seen, but the view from the top and the red run all the way down to the bottom was worth the fright!

    Slovenia has been the best destination so far, with a great hostel environment and amazing scenery it is going to be hard to top these last 4 days!

<h4> Castle 1004</h4>
<p>
    Where to start!! Well I suppose we could start with the fact that we exteded our stay by an extra two nights and that we gave it a 10/10 on <a href="">Booking.com</a>. This hostel is truely amazing, the staff are so friendly and insanely helpful ( saving us 80 euros by telling us of a different way to our next destination ), the facilities were so clean and comfortable despite being in a 12 bed room, the common area had a friendly vibe with a big outdoor terrace that was amazing in the sunshine and the location was right by the lake... we could go on and on about this place
