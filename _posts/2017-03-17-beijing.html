<h3>Beijing</h3>

<p>
    After leaving Mongolia, we had known that the trio of London guys would be on our train to Beijing, funnily enough they were on our carriage, 2 cabins down.
</p>
<p>
    The train ride was hilarious, we took on some 'Chinggus Khan Platinum' vodka to drink with Emma and the lads, and also ended up pretending to be Sweedish, after Emma taught us some Sweedish words, in order to get away from the crazy Mongolian guy who wouldn't leave anyone alone, and was going from cabin to cabin pestering people. 
</p>
<p>
    The scenery was at first amazing to see, but after an hour or so it became rather lack luster as it was just desert and the odd cow/horse/camel. By the morning, it had changed entirely to mountains, rivers and towns. Unfortunately though the fog/smog was too thick to see any of it properly.
</p>
<p>
    We arrived into Beijing at around midday and were picked up by our honcho Mia. Stepping out of the main train station we couldn't believe how busy it was, there were people everywhere!

<h3>Stuff we did</h3>

    Beijing is completely different to anywhere we've been before. The people walking seem so calm and relaxed and walk SO slowly, yet the traffic is pure carnage with a ridiculous amount of cars, mopeds, tri-wheelers, bicyles and walkers, and noone takes notice of red lights, green lights, or people crossing's. I guess we'll have to get used to this!
</p>
<p>
    The first day, we had peking duck pancakes and traditional chinese food for lunch before exploring parts of the old town with the tiny streets and old way of living in the city. We then headed to the night market. It was so busy, bright lights, lots of people and sellers shouting at you to buy scorpions, crickets and cockroaches on a stick. 
</p>
<p>
    The second day was an early start to head to 'The Great Wall of China'. We took a bus, booked through the hotel, to Mutianyu, which is supposed to be less crowded than other parts. It was a stunning sunny day and around 21 degrees, we were so hot as we definitely aren't used to any temperature that's 5+. 
</p>
<p>
    It was an excellent place to explore the wall, you catch a cable car for 100 Yuan (Â£12) return. We walked for around an hour and a half, along the wall from tower 14-21. After tower 20, tourists are not supposed to carry on as the rest of the wall is ruins, however it was amazing to see the old wall too, and the view from tower 21 was incredible, so well worth it. The walk on the wall is pretty tough, and the hike along 18-21 is not for the faint hearted, it is so steep with uneven steps and Kat felt very wobbly going back down and had to hold onto the side of the wall and go sideways down some very narrow, steep steps. 
</p>
<p>
    That was the end of our vodkatrain tour so we moved to the hostel on day 3, but unfortunately for the next couple of days Kat had her first bout of TS (traveller's sickness) and was really unwell, so stayed in the safety of the hotel then hostel most of the time. The air pollution was also awful those 2 days, people were recommended not to go outside if they didn't have to. Now we know the reason why some people wear face masks in the city.
</p>
<p>
    On our final evening in Beijing we met a Norweigen guy, Chris, who took us for dinner nearby in a delicious restaurant. On our way there we bumped into 2 Kiwi travellers, Kelsey and Bernie, who we'd met in St. Petersburg! Such a small world. They met us at the hostel later and we all had drinks and caught up on our travels and chatted until 2am.
</p>
<p>
    The last day we went to the 'Forbidden City', which is gigantic and pretty cool to see where the emporers lived. We then went to visit the 'Temple of Heaven', but unfortunately it was shut. The park there was great though, so nice to be in a quiet green space, and there were lots of young and elderly people playing cards, badminton, hacky sack, and using the outdoor gym. It was amazing to see everyone socialising in the evenings and enjoying spending time together, we even had a go on the gym equipment.

<h4>Hotels &amp; Hostels</h4>

<p>
    The first 2 nights we stayed in the hotel that the vodkatrain had booked us into (we can't remember the name).
</p>
<p>
    Nights 3 &amp; 4 were spent at Leo's Hostel. It was a great hostel, the location was excellent, 10 mins walk to the metro and 20mins walk to the 'Forbidden City'. The rooms were also nice, it had a traditional chinese courtyard, and there was a great communal bar/seating area that did drinks and food and was a good place to meet other travellers. The staff were super friendly and gave good advice, we would definintely recommend staying here.
