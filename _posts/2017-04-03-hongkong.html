    Leaving Zhangjiajie was difficult, not only for it's beautiful views, but for it's remoteness from most forms of public transport that we have been accustom to. First up was the 3 hour bone shaking, nerve rattling bus journey. Which we both had to sit on the floor for the first hour as it was so full. The bus journey was only meant to take 1 hour or so, but due to the traffic it ended up being twice as long. Cant complain when the journey cost 11yuan ( £1.30p ) each.
</p>

<p>
    Thankfully our hotel owner had previously booked our tickets for the 15hour overnight train to Guangzhou (300 Yuan / £35 each), so all we had to do was walk in to the ticket office to collect and head aboard the train. The train was clean and quiet in comparrison to the other trains we have taken in China. The view was also incredible, we watched the sunset over the mountians and river from the train window, it was so beautiful.
</p>

<p>
    We woke up arriving in Guangzhou. Not realising that we had arrived at a different station to the one departing to HK. After a little confusion as no signs were in English and no-one understood us, we soon found the trusty metro which showed us we were at a different station! So we hopped on the metro to Guangzhou East Station. From there we booked a 1st class, the only options are Premier (which is like UK 1st class) or 1st class (our 2nd class) tickets. For 187 Yuan or 210 HKD (£21) we took a 2hr train to Kowloon in Hong Kong.
</p>
<p>
    The train felt so posh! It was as nice as European trains, with an actual western toilet too, not just a hole in the ground, we felt like we were in luxury. The queue’s for immigration and customs in Kowloon were quite long, but got through within 30 mins without a fuss. To get to HK Island we had a few options, metro, bus or boat. As we hadn’t been on a boat for a while we decided to get the metro to TST then go to the star ferry terminal, hopping across the water to Wan Chai for only 2.5HKD (25p) each for a 5 min journey. Eamon met us at the docks on his lunch and took us to his and Mel’s flat, where he works at SPCA.

    We are so greateful to Mel and Eamon for letting us stay at their flat for a week. It was a great opportunity for us to settle and re-couperate after a flat out 2 months to get here, we haven’t stayed anywhere else longer than 4 nights yet and we still can’t believe we haven’t left the ground! 
</p>
<p>
    The day after we arrived was a bank holiday for Hong Kong. This was great as it meant Eamon and Mel had the day off work and we all headed to the beach to relax and surf, funnily called ‘big wave bay’. It was a bit of a mission to get there, as it is traditional for the local Cantonese to visit their dead relatives graves on a bank holiday, which was right where we needed to go through to get to the beach. It was nice to see the local custom though, they took flowers and burnt fake ‘hell money’ on their relatives graves (we still don’t know why though). 
</p>
<p>
    We hiked over a big hill through Sheko Country Park and couldn’t wait to get in the sea, it’s been so long since we’ve been to a beach we miss it so much. It was a lovely warm day, about 24 degrees and sunny, 19 degrees in the water too, so we went with Eamon for a surf. Hired boards for the day for only 50HKD (£5) each, and they were proper fiberglass 9ft longboards too. No wetsuits for us of course, everyone else in the water had one on though, some even had boots on! It felt so good to sunbathe on the sand, be in the water and catch a few waves. 
</p>
<p>
    For the rest of the week, we mainly did some errands, buying toiletries and food, posting some more winter clothes to NZ, got our Vietnamese Visas and Kat bought new trainers (men’s as womens go to 6 ½) and Jack tried and failed as nowhere sold bigger than size 10’s. We met Chloe and Dave too and had homemade duck pancakes one evening and an Indian (in China I know but it was so tasty) at this great BYOB market place. 
</p>
<p>
    On the weekend we headed to Lamma Island with Mel. It’s only about 40mins on the ferry and you can walk from one side to the other and catch a ferry at the opposite terminal back. The islands really nice, tranquil and tropical with a little beach. It was only about 30 HKD (£3) each for a return ticket, and was a nice little escape from the city.

    We were lucky enough to be in HK for the world rugby 7’s tournament. It was brilliant! We spend the whole day there, with Eamon, Mel and Chloe, and had a great time drinking beer, cider and watching world class rugby. The atmosphere was buzzing, with people coming to watch their countries from all over the world, we were right next to some Fijians who were ecstatic when Fiji won! On our final night we had a BBQ on the roof of Mel and Eamons flat, which was a lovely end to the week enjoying the food, company and view of the city lighting up the night sky.
