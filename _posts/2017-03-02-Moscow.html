    From here on, all our transport through Russia, Mongolia and into China, is organised with <a href='http://www.vodkatrain.com'>Vodka Train</a>. The first leg, St. Petersburg to Moscow is an overnight sleeper, this time in a double decker sleeper. The train was a new build, with double <pl></pl>ug sockets in each room, cool temperature and comfortable beds. The 3 of us were in the same room sharing with a Russian chap called Andrei, he was nice. A marathon runner, who was on his way to Moscow to house swap with a friend for the weekend.

    As this was a domestic trip we didn't need to worry about border patrol or anything at midnight, so we actually hit the hay and passsed out arriving in Moscow at 7am

<h4>Moscow</h4>
<p>
    We were met by our Honcho in the train, Vlad, a quiet but nice guy who would be our guide and organiser for our time in Moscow. We were picked up in a large taxi and taken directly to the Hostel, Godzilla Hostel, where we were checked in to another dorm with a group doing the same trip but from Bejing to St. Petersburg. Three Aussie's, Nessa, Joel and Nathan, had arrived in Moscow at 4am, we quickly got on well exchanging stories of our travels so far and talking about the 4 day stint to come from Moscow -> Irkustk. 
</p>
<p>
    We joined forces having 6 of us with 2 Honcho's, we later found out that it was Vlad's first group, so joining up would be better for all parties. We only had a short day in Moscow, so we toured the city going around all the famous sites, Kremlin, where Putin works they also had a couple of catherdrals which date way back to the 1400's. We also went to the red square were we seen the famous Mosk, St. Basil's Cathedral.

    Feeling pretty tired and Kat a little sick, we left the group and headed to the Hostel to get a little nap. We had decided to watch the second most famous performance in Russia, a circus, which was showing at 7pm till 9:20. We paid 2000rubles ( £18 each ), the show was great, although must warn there were some scenes with large animals that we both found a little unsettling. However the arcrobatics and showmanship of the other performances was great. After that we headed to 'Performance bar' a cool cellar pub just down the road to meet up with the others, 6 beers down and a courtosy coffee vodka shot from the owner and it was time for bed

    Godzilla Hostel was great, and was also featured in the Lonely Planets Trans Siberian guide. There was again renovation work being done but the staff were very friendly, free coffee, safe lockers with great showers and kitchen facilities it is a great place to stay if you are looking for a budget place in Moscow.

    They also provide a laundry sevice which is 150rubles ( £2.10p )
