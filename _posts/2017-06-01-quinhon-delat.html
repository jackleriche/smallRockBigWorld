    Up very early to get onto the road at 7.30am before it's too hot. Didn't work, it was already scorching! Road conditions started out good though, with river views, then it got pretty bumpy with no views by the end of the day and we all just wanted to stop. Found a pretty tatty place to stay called ‘Ben Ho Motel’ for 200,000 Dong (£7) for a double room with bathroom, but none of us cared we were all so tired we couldn’t be bothered to look elsewhere.

    Kat had another flat tyre in the morning, so this mechanic fixed it properly this time and managed to stick Troublemakers indicator back on. However, by doing so he must have short circuited the wiring loop and before we were about to go Robert shouted that Jack’s bike was smoking, and it was, a lot! So got that fixed by the mechanic ripping the bike to shreds, then we were all back on the road. 
</p>
<p>
    Main roads today, bit boring town views to start, then a few bumps, before some beautiful scenery towards the gigantic lake at Lien Son. We only did a 3hr / 100km ride today, so we arrived quite early at ‘Moi Thuong Ho Lak’ Motel. 200,000 Dong (£7) for a pretty dated double room with bathroom, but the bed was comfy with a mosquito net so we were happy. We spent the rest of the day exploring around the lake, seen elephants who swam across it, local tribes villages and farms, before chilling on hammocks to watch the sunset over the lake, it’s a hard life.

    Another early rise to hit the road. Most of the journey was very scenic with good roads on the windy hills. Going through the small towns was a bit bumpy and busy. Saw lots of mountains, trees and coffee beans today driving past so many coffee plantations. Apparently Vietnam is the 2nd biggest suppliers of coffee in the world. 
</p>
<p>
    Stopped at the ‘Elephant Falls’ waterfall just before Da Lat too. It was a huge waterfall which sprayed you when you got close, and you could walk (more like climb) down dodgy slippery steps and rocks to the bottom to get even more soaked! It was pretty spectacular, apart from the rubbish that collects on the rocks and banks next to it. Found a Homestay called ‘Organic Garden Hostel’ that we headed for and stayed at.
</p>
<p>
    Family dinner with the owners of Organic Garden Hostel on the first night, followed by some Da Lat rice wine and chatting with a Vietnamese guy called ‘Jackie’ who had just moved there. Kat also helped Nga, a girl who was learning English, by correcting her essay and reading it aloud so that she could help her pronunciations.

    The following day we decided to go canyoning with Viet Challenge. So pleased that we did because it was so much fun! We abseiled down rock faces dropping into the river, swimming and traversing down stream, sliding down rocks, more abseiling, jumping off drops into pools and finally abseiling underneath a waterfall dropping into ‘the whirlpool’ below. Had a lovely picnic on the river bank then trekked back. It was so worth the 900,000 Dong (£30), we had the best day!
</p>
<p>
    That evening we went to the night market and had ‘Da Lat Pizza’s’ which are cooked on little bbq’s with rice paper, egg, cut up sausage and sweet chilli on top. After the night market, we went to ‘The Maze Bar’ which as you can imagine was a maze in a bar! We got lost for a bit and made our way to the top, where we met two Canadians and had a drink with them. Turn’s out Scotty and Adele were also heading to Ho Chi Minh on motorbikes, so after sharing some £1 bottle of rum they’d snuck in, we all decided to travel together the next day. 
</p>
<p>
    Organic Garden Hostel was a lovely cheap homestay just 2km walk from the centre of town. The dorms were double bunk beds and cost only 70,000 Dong (£2.40) each a night. They also did great cheap breakfast, offered dinner with the family which was lovely, and helped with booking the canyoning tours.
