<h3>Bagan</h3>

    Leaving at 11am, we took a shared taxi to Pyin Oo Lwin from Mandalay as there weren’t any big buses or minibuses and the only other available option was to squash with 50 others in (or hang out) the back of a pick-up. It only cost 6,500 Kyats (£4) each for the car and was comfortable, despite scary driving, for the 1 ½ Hr ride winding up the hills, past waterfalls and great views.

    Hooray, it was so much cooler here being around 1200m above sea level, we even got slightly chilly in a t-shirt in the evenings for the first time in months. The day we arrived, we took bicycles from the hotel for free and rode around the town. It’s a very small town, with some old colonial buildings such as; a clock tower, some mansions and an old church. We were admiring the church, when a local asked if we needed directions. He then invited us for a cup of burmese tea (very strong with condensed milk, sounds awful but Lucy and Kat loved it) at a cafe. A little unsure, we then decided it would be fine as he looked well over 70 and it was a public place we went to! 
</p>
<p>
    So glad we agreed to tea. The man’s name was ‘U Kyi Thaw’, pronounced ‘Ooh Gee Door’ (or Henry we nicknamed him), who was a fascinating guy that had amazing stories about the hardships in Myanmar during the times after the war and before the fall of the dictatorship. His wife actually went to prison because he led a peaceful protest with his students. He also published a book with poems (which he signed and gave to us) and tutored Burmese and English privately and at a free school. He then invited us to go to the school the next day to meet the Monk in charge and some of the students, Lucy and Jack were keen and obviously I jumped at the chance.
</p>
<p>
    The following day, we cycled about 8km following U Kyi Thaw to the school. We met the head Monk ‘U Namdaka’ (the Don as Jack called him), whom we had to kneel before and gave him gifts we’d bought the students; some exercise books, pens, pencils, footballs, and badminton equipment. We then were given lunch, chatted more to U Kyi Thaw and his friend, before meeting the students. It was quite an experience! 66 pupils of 15/16 years old all squeezed into a classroom smaller than some I’ve taught in before, all standing and singing to you as you walk in the room. Jack and Lucy didn’t want to stand in the front being stared at when asked to go ‘on stage’ (they actually have a stage at the front) and went to the back. I stayed at the front and answered lots of questions about my age and work, the U.K, what school is like for students at home, and then one of them asked me to sing. If I was at home, I would flat out refuse, but these kids were so excited to hear me sing an English song that I sang about 2 lines from a One Direction song that Jamie Vardy loved to sing the day before! It was very embarrassing, but also very memorable and a great experience. 
</p>
<p> 
    We cycled back up hill towards town, had another brew with Henry and his mate, said farewell and went to the Botanical Gardens. Paying 6,000 Kyats (£4) entry, we walked around the big park with flowers, swans, an aviary, a funky looking native animal like a cow/moose in an enclosure, a huge lake with massive fish and a big 50M high tower that we climed up for incredible panoramic views of mountains and jungles. Exhausted, we headed to a delicious indian next to our hotel called ‘Taj’ for a super cheap dinner.

<h4>Accomodation</h4>
<p>
    Thiha Bala Hotel was a relatively new place, with very comfy beds, a big T.V with English films on Fox (we watched Harry Potter and the new Ghostbusters). They also did an incredible buffet breakfast, which was included in the price of our triple room with A/C and a private bathroom for 10,000 Kyats (£7) each per night.

<h3>Hsipaw</h3>

<p>
    Early rise to get the 08:20 train to Hsipaw. The train journey is famous for its large spanning single tracked bridge, the ‘Goteik Viaduct’ over a huge gorge. Our carriage was packed with tourists, all looking out at the incredible scenery. The train journey from Pyin Oo Lwin to Hsipaw costs 2,400 kyat (£1.40) each for a upper class ticket and the views really were spectacular.

<h4>What we did:</h4>
<p>
    Hsipaw offers treks, but otherwise many people would simple go there just to do the train journey back to Mandalay, or vice versa. We ended up staying a few nights, the five of us (Lucy and the Dutch) managed to keep ourselves amused for a few days. However, due to the heat we opted to do the Kalaw -> Inle Lake trek instead.
    Mr. Shakes in famous in Hsipaw, so famous in fact that other milkshake cafe’s have copied the name. The place does amazing milkshakes though and the food is great, so good in fact that we went twice, to the original one, in two days.
</p>
<p>    
    Mr Food is also a good chinese restaurant, cheap and cheerful, with great tasting food. Now that I think about it a lot of the place’s’ were ‘Mr. something’ how odd.
</p>
<p>
    We had heard of a waterfall about 10km away from our guesthouse, so we hired bikes for the day for 2,500 Kyats (£1.40) each and set off in the scorching heat. Using nothing more than our badly hand-drawn map, we managed to find our way to the waterfall, after being told by locals which way to go. A small trek past farmers land, a dump, then up stream and we were there. Sweating buckets once we arrived we just wanted to jump in, not sure if it was safe or not… luckily some locals were there eating then jumped in to show us it was safe to do so. It was a lovely big unspoilt waterfall, with a refreshing pool to plunge in.  
</p> 
<p>
    Kat got heat stroke… She wasn't feeling too great after the waterfall, opting for bed over beers the night before. Of course (as we all do away) she thinks its Malaria / Dengai (or both), but after we upgraded our bed to an air-con room, and a day of relaxing in the cool, she was right as rain. Lucy and I ended up heading out trying to find something to do, we met the Dutch and headed to a noodle factory, but after 1 hour of waiting for the ball of dough to cook, it kind of lost our attention. So we headed back to the guest house after a bite to eat at Mr. Charles guest house.
</p>    
        
<h4>Accomodation</h4>
<p>
    ‘Yee Shin Guest House’ was very budget, but fine. The decor is a bit tired, box rooms, beds were comfortable though. The free breakfast is always an added bonus and at 9000 kyats (£5) per person per night, you can’t complain. After Kat got sick, we upgraded to an A/C room with private bathroom, which we shared with Lucy. 42,000 Kyats for the room which works out £7.50
