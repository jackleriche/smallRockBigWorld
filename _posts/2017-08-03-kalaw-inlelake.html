<h3>Kalaw</h3>

<h4>Transport</h4>
<p>
    12 hours of minibus, got us from Hsipaw to Kalaw. After a bit of confusion at the guesthouse, we booked the bus for 25,000 Kyats (£15) each, which actually took us via Inle Lake (where we were headed next) on the way to drop others off. The only other option to this, is a cheaper night bus via Mandalay, which Robert and Laura took, but we’d already booked the day bus, which was better for me (Kat) as I was still not 100% anyway. Very picturesque (but bumpy and scary driving of course) route through windy hills, local villages and great gorges.

<p>
    We didn’t do a lot in Kalaw, as the main reason we went was to do the trek to Inle Lake (as below). However, we walked around the town to the market, had delicious lunch at Thu Maung Myanmar restaurant, before we went to the driving range of all places! 2,000 Kyats (£1.20) each for 50 balls and borrowed some clubs, too small for all of us, but it was good fun as Laura and I had never done it before, so Jack showed us the ropes. Beers and dinner at Everest that evening with some other travellers at the hostel before chatting and drinking ridiculously cheap pints of Gin and Tonic around the camp fire, not the best idea before a 3 day trek!

<h4>Accomodation</h4>
<p>
    Railroad Hotel was the name of our guesthouse. It had a great vibe with other travellers staying there, free breakfast and cost 9,000 Kyats (£6) for a bed in the 8-bed dorm with 2 bathrooms. The staff helped us find good places to eat and who to book our trek with also.

<h3>3 day Trek</h3>

<h4>Transport:</h4>
<p>
    So, our transport to Inle Lake was a 3 day, 60km walking trek. We’d booked it with ‘Ever Smile’ and it cost 45,000 Kyats (£30) each for 3 days of trekking with a guide, 2 nights stay at homestays in local villages, and 3 meals a day, bargain. There were 10 people in our group, all travellers from various countries and we had a blast.

<h4>Day 1:</h4>
<p>
    fairly uneventful, bit drizzly, walked both on tracks and gravel roads, through woods with pine trees (high up here) and native villages, where the kids at the school all ran to us and wanted to play ‘pattacake’. Our guide ‘momon’ was hilarious. He told us great stories about the area and his own life. That evening we stayed at a homestay in a concrete barn, all on sunbed style mats in a room together. We had a delicious feast cooked for us, had to wash with buckets of really cold water outside in a shack, and had a few beers.

<h4>Day 2:</h4>
<p>
    Mud fest day. It rained all through the night and pretty much the whole day of our trekking. We got soaked through early on, and had to trudge through fields and tracks all day with about a foot of sloppy, sticky, red mud. Everyone was pretty fed up after lunch and spirits were low, but luckily the sun shone for us later and momon’s stories made us feel better. The trudge was really tough though, so glad to reach out bamboo hut homestay for night 2, where we had another hug meal, beers and sang around a campfire with guides from other groups.

<h4>Day 3:</h4>
<p>
    Up and down and across the river. Feet were pretty sore, especially after day 2 hauling them through mud, so we were all glad it was mainly downhill. Sunnier day with incredible views of the surroundings and the lake. Terrain was much easier, though we had a steep descent over rocks through jungle to the lake at the end. Stopped for lunch, said goodbye to Momon and took out 5 man skinny canoe with an engine, for an hour across the gigantic lake, to Nyuang Shwe, the village we stayed in. Lucy and I went straight for a 90 min massage, which was heavenly, before the 3 of us had huge pizzas for dinner.

<h3>Inle Lake</h3>

<h4>What we did:</h4>
<p>
    Spent a few days resting after our big trek and thinking about what we’re all doing next. We hired bicycles from our Guesthouse for 2,000 Kyats (£1.20) again and went for a cycle with Robert and Laura to a ‘natural pool’ which was cool. We also met Lucy, Sammy and Tori and went wine tasting at the ‘Red Mountain Winery’. For 5,000 Kyats (£3) each, you got 4 small glasses of wine, 2 white and 2 red, it was lovely to have wine again! Another thing we did was horse riding to a cave, but we won’t talk much about that experience as Jack hated it so. To be fair it was pretty weird and boring being led through a busy town on a gypsy pony walking on roads for 4 hours, nothing like our Mongolian galloping through snow, won’t be doing anymore horse riding in South East Asia for sure.

<p>
    We also did a classic touristic boat tour along the river. For the 3 of us, Jack, Lucy and I, we hired a skinny canoe thing for 20,000 Kyats (£12) for the whole boat that can take 5. Doing the normal tourist loop they all do, we went to; the morning market, visited the ‘long neck women’ who wear those very heavy (up to 10 kg's) gold rings around their necks and some on their knees, Silversmiths which was very interesting, Lotus Flower weaving to make scarfs, a big pagoda, through the floating villages and floating gardens, then the old jumping cat monastery where they don’t make the cats jump anymore, they all just laze around getting stroked.

<h4>Accomodation</h4>
<p>
    Ostello Bello is where we stayed for the first couple of nights. It’s huge and full of backpackers with lots of dorms, free breakfast, free tea &amp; coffee, lots of help planning stuff, plus entertainment every night for 12,500 Kyats (£8.50) each per night. We got rather drunk the first night and stayed in a nice quiet 4 bed dorm with Lucy. They then realised, Jack was in a ‘female only’ dorm, so he and I had to move to the 14 bed dorm that was very noisy with 7 Spanish people who were up until 1am, then all being really noisy again getting up at 5am to head out, so we left. 
</p>
<p>
    Teak Hotel we stayed at for the last couple of nights, which suited us much better. 25,000 Kyats (£14) got us a basic double room with private bathroom, fan and free breakfast. It was really sweet and a family run hotel with lovely staff.
