<h4>The second stint of the trans Mongolian train journey</h4>
<p>
    Leaving the lake behind was difficult but we were ready to see what Mongolia had to offer, but first another train journey taking us from Irkutsk to Ulaanbaatar, this would take 33 hours, and would consist of the longest immergration process we have had to date
</p>

<p>
    Stocking up on some more supplies as the train would not have a food carriage this time, we added on to our original source which included:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>6 x honey and nut instant porridge</li>
    <li>2 x packs of chicken noodles (containing actual meat)</li>
    <li>4 x oranges</li>
    <li>4 x bananas</li>
    <li>4 x apples</li>
    <li>pack of green tea</li>
</ul>

<p>This seen us sufficiently through the 2 days on board the train</p>

<p>
    The train journey itself didnt really have much about it, very boring, time was spent mainly reading. But with the Mongolian border approaching we had read that we would have a few hours of interrogation ahead of us. After 8 hours of handing over passports and getting out of cabin, opening bags, looking directly at the passport woman we made it into Mongolia.
</p>
<p>
    Our tour guide in Irkutsk had told us that we would arrive for midday, as the ticket had said 5:45am she added the 5 hours on, a weird thing they do in Russia is go by Moscow time. However we were woken at 5:00am the following morning by the carriage attendent to get ready for our stop.

<h4>Ulaanbaatar</h4>
<figure class="right">
    <img src="/images/mongolia/pic31.png" />
</figure>
<p>
    Getso, our honcho for our time in Mongolia, arrived to meet us and take us to our hostel. Once we arrived we dropped our bags and continued our sleep until midday when Getso would come to show us around the capital city of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar.
</p>
<p>
    We walked to the main square where we seen the parlament building, with a huge monument of Chinggis ( Gengis ) Khan, his son and grandson, the three most famous of Mongolian Kings.
</p>
<p>
    After that we grabbed a bite to eat, then went to the tallest monument in Ulaanbaatar which was built in celebration and friendship of the red army and Mongolia. There was a great view of the city below, but unfortunately due to the rise of Ulaanbaatar in such short time, the city is coated in a cloud of smog. More then half the population live in the city and during the winter months they burn alot of coal which contributes to the pollution.
</p>

<h4>Terelj National Park</h4>
<p>
    Heading out at around midday from Ulaanbaatar, we were about an hour and a half drive from the Terelj National Park, were we would experience what its like to live in a Ger Camp for the next two nights.
</p>
<p>
    Driving through the national park was pure bliss, no high rise buildings, no other cars, just cattle and horses roaming freely in the snow. Kat and I climbed to the top of the hill that our camp was based, standing at the top was silent and peaceful. But the view from the top was worth the climb, 360 panorama of snowy mountains and nothing but white.
</p>
<p> 
    During our stay at the national park we would be catered for, eating local Mongolian food which was great, and allowed us to really get stuck in with evrything that the park had to offer.
</p>

<p>
    First on the list was Mongolian horse riding, Kats used to larger horses, but these guys are around 13'2hh ( only 138cm at their shoulders if you dont speak horsey terms! ). The horse riding would end up at a local nomads ger, but before that we would canter and trott our way through fields of snow and take in the amazing scenery. Jacks first time on a horse and after having to switch from the bigger horse to a smaller one due to his feet not fitting in the stirup, and after the inital trepidation of it kicking him in the face, he was fine. We trotted and cantered our way to a nomads settlement, where we entered his ger and Getso told us about their way of life, while talking sports ( as it was on the tele ), we shared some homemade bread snacks and fermented horse milk ( alcoholic ), Jack had some snuff as is tradition of the men to share. 
</p>

<p>
    Arriving back to the ger camp, we watched 'bad grandpa' started on the beers and shared stories of our travels so far. After some dinner, and a few too many beers, we joined the other group who were a trio of London lads, great laugh with them before heading for sleep at 2am
</p>

<p>
    Up early for our breakfast, before husky sleding on a frozen lake. The 30 min drive would take us to the middle of the national park, and well off the beaten track before we seen the massive array of kennels for them. After a little play of the frozen lake while waiting for the dogs and the guides to arrive, we were greeted with three packs of 10 huskies, black, brown and grey teams. We were told they were all part of a family per sled, the dogs themselves were great fun to play with and loooked extremly happy, jack wanted to take one home after making friends with most of them. We shared a sled and followed Emma and the guide on the frozen lake, the dogs struggle with the two of us but they did well after a 15 min break. We did a loop of the lake, which lasted about 30-40 mins. After returning we were allowed to have a go on the quad bike for free, Jack drove, Kat screamed while we danced on the ice with all wheels spinning!
</p>
<p>
    Once we arrived back at the camp, we had lunch ( 3 courses ), the dressed in traditional mongolian attire, took a few snaps then played some traditional mongolian games, using sheep ankle bones. Who knew there was so many different games to play ( 37 odd in total ), we played 4: horse race, jacks, flicking pairs and tanks
</p>
<p>
    Very sad to leave the tranquil national park, we set off to the biggest horsemen statue in the world, which is privately owned, of Chinggis Khan. The steel statue is a whopping 40m high, 1m higher then christ the redeemer, which you can climb inside and stand on the horses head. The vieiws from the top were amazing of the surrounding mountainous desert. 
</p>
<p>
    That afternoon, as if we hadn't packed enough in the last two days, we decided to go for our fifth ski of the trip! <a href='http://www.skyresort.mn'>Sky resort</a> is only 10km out of the capital city of Ulaanbaatar, it was bizzare to be skiing on the slopes with sky scrapers in the background. As it was mid week it cost us a massive 20000 tögrög ( £6 ), for three hours of skiing and equipment hire, which we gathered was ex french / japanese stuff as it was so tatty. The resort has 5 runs, 2 beginner, 1 intermediate, 1 expert and a snow park, which was unfortunately closed. The lift was pretty slow but the piste was bashed well and the runs were empty, plus we cant really complain at the price.

<p> 
    The hostel only had one other guest at the time of our stay, which was unfortunate. But the hostel itself was really nice, we think it may have had a recent renovation as all the rooms and beds were new and clean, as were the toilets and showers.
</p>
<p>
    It was the first hostel that we have visited that had mixed toilets, but think this may be a more common occurence the further east we go.
</p>
<p>
    A very basic breakfast was included, filter coffee, tea and toast with a selection of jams/honey available. We did also find some biscuits or cakes left on some mornings
</p>
<p>
    Hostels location was ideal on peace avenue, very close to the center of Ulaanbaatar and positioned conviniently to one of the more iconic buildings, <a href='http://www.booking.com/hotel/mn/blue-sky-ulaanbaatar.en-gb.html?aid=311984;label=blue-sky-ulaanbaatar-TuSH5LcVBmiwVL3m8dEMhgS162169028616%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap1t1%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atiaud-146342135830%3Akwd-41324013123%3Alp1032237%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm;sid=0001cf150a6b4cd40e5df6ec049641a8;checkin=2017-03-25;checkout=2017-03-27;ucfs=1;highlighted_blocks=45647019_89090047_1_1_0;all_sr_blocks=45647019_89090047_1_1_0;room1=A;hpos=1;dest_type=city;dest_id=-2353539;srfid=6ad0bf0523024bbb71b40c1a9fee79a43b0031c3X1;from=searchresults;highlight_room=;shp=1#hotelTmpl' target='_blank'>The Blue Sky Hotel</a>
