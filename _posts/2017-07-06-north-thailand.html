<h3>Bangkok</h3>

<h4>Transport</h4>
<p>
    Leaving Siem Reap we booked a bus online with Giant Ibis, 32$ for the two of us. Slightly more expensive than other options, but we decided it was worth it to stay on the same bus and they also provide food and drinks.
</p>

<h4>What we did:</h4>
<p>
    Arriving in Bangkok we had no idea what to do or what we were even doing here. Thailand wasn’t on our list originally, but here we are in Bangkok. Getting off the bus we had no Baht at all. 15km away from our Hostel, tried to get cash out…. nothing, declined. Checked my Monzo app, money on the card. Apparently the monzo service was down, great. Kat was going to use her credit card…. Couldn’t find it… lost. Left in Ho Chi Minh - vietnam inn - saigon. Cracking start to Thailand. Changed the $40 we had from Cambodia, was enough to get us to our hostel.. But what a palava

<h3>Chiang Mai</h3>

<h4>Transport</h4>
<p>
    Booked the train in Bangkok, we’d have rather done the overnight sleeper, unknowingly it was a public holiday, and all overnight trains were booked for 9 days. We opted for the 12 hour day train, cost 614 baht (£15) for the two of us in an A/C carriage leaving Bangkok at 8:30am. The views for the last 3 hours were amazing, winding through jungle passes and through small villages. The three of us ( Ellen joined us on the train ), just watched the world go by.

<h4>What we did:</h4>
<p>
    There are local markets running on both saturday and sunday. We visited both, the saturday one is smaller and sells a great selection of street food, we got 2 pad thais, spring rolls and two sausage on a sticks for 150baht ( £3 ). 
</p>
<p>
    Inside the walls of Chiang Mai are safe for bikes, so we rented a bike for a day from a friendly local guy who owned the music museum. 50baht (£1.10p) for 24 hours, we cycled around for a few hours just deciding which turn to take as we got there.
</p>
<p>
    Motorcycles are available to hire, costing between 200Baht to 1000 Baht, we opted for two small 125 moped’s (200baht) to do the 100km loop around Chiang Mai’s national forest. Incredible views and lovely winding roads which were in good nick, we enjoyed our couple of hours out on the bikes
</p>
<p>
    Also applied for our New Zealand one year working visa’s, filled out the necessary forms and sent them away. Receiving them back within two days, accepted!! And handed our passports over to the Myanmar embassy along with:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Passport copies</li>
    <li>2 photos</li>
    <li>Visa forms</li>
    <li>Hotel booking confirmation</li>
    <li>Transport booking confirmation</li>
    <li>1600 Baht (£35)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We’d received our passports in 3 days, so we decided to head to Pai while we wait.
</p>

<h4>Hostel's</h4>
<p>
    Originally staying at ‘Near the Park inn’ which wasn’t terrible, but just didn't help us meet people or lift spirits, been feeling a bit lost since entering Thailand, so moved to join Ellen at ‘Hug Hostel’ 220 Baht (£4.50) each a night in a 12 bed dorm, but much nicer. Food is fairly expensive but across the road there are many food stools at night for cheap street food.

<h3>Pai</h3>

<h4>Transport</h4>
<p>
    We decided to get a bus costing 150Baht (£3) to our next destination, Pai, rather than motorbike. While riding is a popular option, over the last few days we have had heavy rain in the afternoons, wet forest roads, large packs, poor visibility.. It did end up raining slightly en route so glad we chose the bus. Windy roads up to Pai, the driver's skill was questionable, and at times Jack felt like asking the guy to take his seat and let him drive. But after 3.5 hours we made it.  
</p>

<h4>What we did:</h4>
<p>
    We met Ellen again at Pai circus hostel, sat around the ‘infinity’ pool with a few beers, strictly Leo after our change-over in Chiang Mai. 
</p>
<p>
    Pai has safe, empty roads, and most visitors rent a bike for a day or two and explore. So we did just that, went into town and rented a bike for 140 Baht (£3) for 24 hours + 5 hours (low season special). Visited the Pai Canyon, The big white buddha, ww2 memorial bridge, a few waterfalls. 
</p>
<p>
    The second day we headed out early after finding a lesser known hot spring that was 20km away, cost 5 times less than the touristy one in the town, 50Baht each, 20 for the entrance to the national park, 20 for the Hot spring, and 10 each for the bike. The springs were nice, a nice 30c temperature so more like a relaxing bath, we stayed for 45 minutes. Small cafe’s are by the springs, we had Pad Thai before heading further into the national forest and try getting to ‘Hermit Cave’. On the trail we saw 0 tourists, past 2 villages, and scaled up and down many mountains. The scenery around was breathtaking and the photo’s won’t do it justice. We didn’t make it to Hermit crab after the trial turned for the worse, maybe if we had a larger dirt bike.

<h4>Hostel</h4>
<p>
    The Famous Pai Circus is a great place to stay offering either bungalows or dorm rooms. We opted for the bungalow, costing 400Baht (£8) for the two of us a night, these come without A/C but Pai is slightly cooler than the rest of Southeast Asia. The internet is decent enough to stream netflix, shared toilets are basic but clean and the guesthouse offers a few classes free of charge. Included in the price is a free buffet breakfast, sausages, rice, toast, eggs, waffles.
