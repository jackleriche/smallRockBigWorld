<h3>Budapest</h3>

<h4>Transport</h4>
<p>
    After being advised to not go through Austria, saving 120euros, we went via Ljibljiana from the train via Lesce Bled cosing 10euros for the two of us and taking 1 hour, from Ljibljiana we then grabbed the Budapest train costing 58euros for the two, word of advice, if you know when you want to go, it is worth booking in advance and you could get the special offer of 9euros a ticket, this train takes 8.5 hours to arrive in Budapest.  
</p>
<p>
    The long train from Ljibljiana to Budapest had a caffteria in it which we went to for lunch, beers cost 1.50euros and the food wasnt bad either, with Kat having a Ceaser salad and Jack having BBQ chicken sandwich and chips. The views from the train was mainly of flat grassland and was quite foggy so not much to see out the window.

<h4>Buda - Pest</h4>
<p>
    Aftter our exhilerating time in Bled and sore shoulders/backs from lugging our packs around, we were in much need of some R&R so we went to the Largest Thermal Spa that Budapest has to offer, Szechenyi Bath. There were 15 different pools with saunas and steam rooms at various temperatures, indoors and out. Kats favorite was the 34c outdoor pool where the air temperature was -1 and the pool felt so warm, it also had a whirlpool, which reminded us of the Merton back home!
</p>
<p>
    We also splashed out and had a beer spa, which was a drunken experience. 20euros each for 45 minutes which included a 2 man bath, which was flavored with malt, barley and hops, but the really gem of the expereince was the unlimited beer tap next to the bath, which you could help yourself too for 45 minutes, working out, with some beer mat maths, is around 5-6 pints before you started saving money each. between the two of us we managed 8 pints so not bad going
</p>
<p>
    We also went on a 2.5hour <a href="http://www.facebook.com/freebudapestwalkingtours2007">free walking tour</a> which is based on a tipping service, it was a great way to learn about the histry of Hungary, the city and good places to go, and we would highly recommend doing this if you ever find yourself in Budapest.
</p>
<p>
    Our friend Walter who we met in Bled joined us on the last night, so we went for a couple of drinks at the Szimpla Pub in the Jewish district, again highly recommend visiting this place it was interesting to say the least with good music and local wine and beers, also when you're spending 5 pound a round it is hard to leave!

<h4>Essential Hostel</h4>
<p>
    The hostel is in the Pest side of Budapest, and luckily for us next to one of the two tallest buildings in Budapest, St. Stephen Basilica, a giant cathedral. This was really useful when exploring Busapest as it was a beacon to find our way back to the hostel.
</p>
<p>
    The hostel it's self was nice, with a very minimalist feel, hense the name, but gave you some privacy in the beds with a curtain shutting you off from the rest of the dorm. The storage facilites were great with a trunk for big luggage and a smaller hanging storage box in your pod for toiletries and electrics, it also doubled up as a good place to put the laptop to watch Taboo on BBC iplayer!
</p>
<p>
    The hostels staff were very friendly again, helping us on the last night to advise us which bars to go to and a free dinner was cooked on the Friday night, breakfasts were included in the price ( amazing what 7euros a night pp can get you ). Bathrooms and showers were very much shared, with 4 cubicles in both the shower and bath room, showers were powerful but had no holder so you had to hold the shower head. 
</p>
<p> 
    Overall Essential Hostel provided a high quality value for money stay
