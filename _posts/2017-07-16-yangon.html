<h3>Mawlamyine</h3>

<h4>Transport</h4>
<p>
    Booked a bus online, Green Bus, from Chiang Mai to Mae Sot (Thai / Myanmar Border) costing 290 Baht each (£6). Bus was fairly old but on the plus side we got free water and snacks for the journey. The 5 and a half hour advised time took 7 hours, something we have quickly come to realise is that the bus is never on time!
</p>
<p>
    Lucy was joining us at the border, but she was coming from Bangkok, once she arrived it was a tuk tuk for a couple of kilometers to the friendship bridge.
</p>
<p>
    The woman at the thai border control was pretty miserable, crossed out our details we filled in and handed the exit slips back. Not knowing what was going on we were confussed, turns out we had each others slips... But aside from that the process was very simple, stamp out of Thailand, a walk across the bridge and a simple entrance process (photo, form fillinng) on the Myanmar side.
</p>
<p>
    The town on the Myanmar side is called Myawaddy, and it doesnt have anything going for it. So we had read that the best place to go for connections to the rest of Myanmar is Mawlamyine. We had done some research and knew we'd be paying about $10 to get there, it is a 4 hour journey, once we found the taxi service. Luckily the taxi seervice found us, and before we knew it we were in a random guy's white estate, heading to Mawlamyine.
</p>

<h4>What we did:</h4>

<p>
    We didnt have much time in Mawlamyine, I dont think there's much to do. We hired push bikes from the guest house and headed to the train station to book our onward tickets to Yangon. While we were out on the bikes we headed to a new shopping mall and a park. 
</p>
<p>
    We found out that it was 'Matyre's Day' today, so all the museums were closed, so what else to do but taste the local beers. 500ml of Myanmars finest beer (it's not great.. local rice brewed) set you back 800 kyats (50p). To see the day out we headed for a indian curry called 'Daw Yee restaurant', it doesnt have the best presentation, but we cannt complain when a selection of food, (including Jack's second dish of curried beef), and beers each cost 13,000 kyats (£6)
</p>

<h4>Accomodation</h4>
<p>
    Mawlamyine isnt on the tourist trail and because of this there is only a small selection of guesthouses available. 'Breeze Guesthouse' is where we stayed. On the recommendations of <a href='www.seat61.com' >seat61</a> and <a href='www.loneyplanet.com'>Loney Planet</a>. It's old, a bit run down. But it was fine, beds were comforotable enough, floors were tidy, bathrooms cleaned and free breakfast is never a bad thing! 
</p>
<p>
    $28 for the two of us for two night's, not bad, but certainly not the best. We have heard that accomodaion in Myanmar is more expensive, but you make up for it everywhere else

<h3>Yangon</h3>

<h4>Transport</h4>

<p>
    Train from Mawlamyine to Yangon, leaving at 8am would take us 12 hours to get there. 250km of very slow 'clickity klack' on open window carriages. These trains are old! and we would recommend if you ever take them to opt for 'upper class'. for the extra $1 or so its worth it. The scenery was amazing, heading through rice paddies and small villages, past mountains dotted with golden Pagoda's. Children would run by the side of the train shouting 'hello' and waving frantically.
</p>
<p> 
    You wont go hungry on these trains, with extended stops at a few stations you have time to hop off, grab some tasty treats and soak in the culture. If you were asleep during these stop's, then you always have the on board sellers pacing the aisle selling drinks, corn and even curries. The woman carry tray's of fruit on their heads even as the train rocks from side to side, wearing their tradition face paint and clothing. 
</p>
<p>
    We arrived in at Yangon at 6pm, grabbed a taxi and headed to our Hostel
</p>

<h4>What we did:</h4>
<p>
    Shwedagon Pagoda is the a 99 meter gold plated spire, and the main reason any traveller comes to Yangon. It is also Myanmars most important Buddhist site and can be seen from mostly anywhere in Yangon. Unfortunately the day we went it was raining, so the colours didnt really pop, but it was a site to see none the less.  
</p>
<p>
    We also walked through the 'People's Park' on the west of the Shwedagon Pagoda site, quite odd, has a roller coaster ride, a small fun fair, markets, lover's lake and 2 old fighter planes in there... absolutely bizare.
</p>
<p>
    The Burmese LOVE tea.. so Kat was excited to try some out. We headed to 'Rangoon Tea House', which brings a modern look to a very ancient tradition. We ended up eating there, they have a wide selection of foods, although slightly pricer then your average restaurant, you wont be dissapointed. The service was top notch, the waiter helped the girls select their tea's, explaining the auromas and tastes to them (I stuck with black coffee), and the portions were big, plus an added cheese cake and you'll be looking at £20 for 2.
</p>
<p>
    Bogyoke Aung San Market, is just madness. An indoor market which sells just about anything you could think of. Jewelry, lungies, coffee, toys, shirts, traditional medicines, I'm sure I even seen wildstock in there?!? We found some Burmese blue mountain coffee called 'Moony Moon', so we had to buy it.
</p>
<p>
    To end the day we went to Basement bar for a jazz night, 1 liter jugs of beer are whats on tap. 3500 kyats (£2) a glass its easy to sink a few down, the band are great from what I can remember
</p>
<p>
    Kat and Lucy went to a foot spa &amp; massage parlour named 'Royal Jasmine' the following day to nurse the hangover. Price costs around 12,000 kyats (10,000 in offseason). The girls said it was one of the best massages she'd ever had, shoulders, neck, back, arms and legs. I couldnt stop laughing at the tradition face paint they had on, they seemed relaxed anyway.
</p>

<h4>Accomodation</h4>
<p>
    'Hostel 9' was our hostel in Yangon, and I couldn't recommend it more highly. The staff are very nice, speak amazing English, free breakfast, decent wi-fi, comfortable beds (we stayed in a dorm), shared bathroom's which were spotless. We paid half price from high season so it only cost us £5 a night each. Its location is right by China town, Yangon is huge however and doesnt have a metro, best option to get around the city is to use <a href='https://www.grab.com/'>Grab</a>
