<h5>Krui - Jakarta</h5>
<p>
    Wow, another extremely long night and day travelling! 24hrs on buses and boats and we were shattered. So fed up with buses! We did manage to sleep a little on the overnight bus from Krui to Jakarta. SAN bus again, costing 350,000 RP (£19) each for ‘super executive’ bus and boat from Sumatra to Java. The coach had really comfy leather seats, cool air-con and the driving was actually good. 9hrs from Krui to the harbour, 2hrs on a very slow big ferry, then 3hrs to Terpadu Sentra bus terminal in Jakarta.

<h5>Jakarta - Pangandaran</h5>
<p>
    The lovely staff at Terpadu Sentra helped us find the bus from there heading to ‘Tasik Malaya’ for 70,000RP (£4) each. Another nice bus, but lots of traffic so it took around 7 hrs. We then changed bus in ‘Badung’ at a petrol station for the public bus to Pangandaran. 50,000RP (£2.75) each for a very squashed, sweaty and smokey bus! Arrived in the evening very ready for food and sleep.

<p>
    Went to the beach and chilled out. Played in the waves on some big foam rental boards but it was quite dumpy. We then hired mopeds for 50,000RP (£2.75) per day for 3 days to ride the 1hr beautiful journey to Batukaris for a couple of days. Definitely the best way to get there, past the Green Canyon and beautiful rice paddies and palm trees. It was also great to get back on bikes again!
</p>
<p>
    Batukaris was a lovely place. Very chilled out vibes with lots of local and ex-pat longboarders. We had a great couple of days hiring out some proper 9ft longboards and playing 3 times a day on the long 2ft waves. The restaurants were great there too and we had some delicious fish.

<h4>Accommodation:</h4>
<p>
    ‘Panorama A La Plage’ is where we stayed for 2 nights in Pangandaran. A nice ‘hippyesque’ hostel with amazing huge breakfasts and free tea/coffee! No doubles yet so booked a twin room that was 170,000RP (£7) a night for both of us. Only 2 bathrooms for lots of guests though and no air-con, but price was cheap and the sea-breeze was enough to keep us cool.

<p>
    ‘Putra Sindang Asih’ is where we stayed for 2 nights in Bataukaris. We booked a standard double + fan room for 150,000 (£6) per night for two of us, but got upgraded for free to a suite with 2 double beds + air con and the oldest fattest TV ever! Very comfortable stay, could keep our bikes outside and the breakfast included was lovely banana pancakes plus coffee and fruit, absolute bargain.
