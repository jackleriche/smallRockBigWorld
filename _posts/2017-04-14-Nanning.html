<h3>Nanning</h3>

<h4>Transport</h4>

<p>
    Our next stop was Nanning, China's most southern city, and connecting terminal to Hanoi. Unfortunately Yangshuo offers no direct train to Nanning, it does have a direct bus, but that is a 6-7hour journey and we thought it would be quicker to get the train from Guilin, as there is a train leaving almost every twenty minutes..
</p>
<p>
    Leaving our guesthouse at 9am, we had about an hours walk with our packs to the Northern Bus terminal. Here we caught the express bus to Guilin costing 27Yuan (£3.50p) each. This journey takes roughly 1.5 hours and was fairly pleasent (air-con). Due to it being a saturday it was VERY busy.
</p>
<p>
    The bus stopped near the train station so we decided to hop straight in and get the earliest train to Nanning, unfortunately this was 6 hours away.. The bullet train to Nanning cost 111 Yuan (£12) each, again fairly uneventful but quick! 
</p>
<p>
    Arriving at the Nanning east station, this looks fairly new, and had a metro underground, so jumped on that to our hostel in the centre of the city costing around 2 Yuan (30p) each

<p>
    Our first birthday abroad!! Jack's 29th, in the most uneventful city in China. Looking around the city we didnt see one tourist, probably because of how cheap it is to go from China or Hong Kong to Hanoi now, most people would opt for the sky. 
</p>
<p>
    We spent today walking through the city firstly to the train station to book a train to Hanoi, only to find it fully booked for a further 6 days, then heading too the bus station to book the bus to Hanoi instead. 
</p>
<p>
    After that we walked down the shopping street, bought a top, socks and flip flops for the birthday boy, before heading back to the Hostel for a few beers costing 5Yuan (60p).
</p>
<p>
    Nanning also has a night market which, like many other night markets, offers a great selection of food. We went and got spiced herb black pudding, dumplings and some bread. All fairly cheap 10Yuan (£1.10p) a dish. As the only Western tourists around, we stuck out like sore thumbs as we often do! So lots of people were taking photos of us, asking for selfies with us and just wanting to say 'Hello' in English. We wonder if it's going to be like this in Vietnam too.

<p>
    We stayed at Travel with Hostel. We ended up staying 2 nights as we didnt want to travel on Jack's birthday. 2 nights for a private double room cost 212Yuan (£27). The hostel was great, the staff were exceptionally helpful, the food they serve is great, and the beers were cheap too.   
</p>
<p>
    The room we had was cosy, with towels, toiletries and air con it was great to hide from the 34c heat that wee had after our walks around Nanning. We didn't get many photo's from this City, and we didn't do a lot either so apologise for this post being a bit bland!'
