    The biggy... the train from Moscow to Irkutsk, this is the longest we've slept in one place so far of the trip.... and its on a train! A neccessary evil if we want to get from one side of Russia to Mongolia without air travel, so what does it entail?
</p>

    In Moscow we bought supplies for the train. As there is boiling water at the end of each carriage, these included:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>8 x packets of instant porridge</li>
    <li>4 x packets of instant noodles ( various flavours )</li>
    <li>4 x instant soups ( various flavours )</li>
    <li>4 x apples</li>
    <li>4 x bananas</li>
    <li>2 x boxes of breakfast bars</li>
    <li>1 x dried banana chips</li>
    <li>1 x packet of peanuts</li>
    <li>1 x dried apricots</li>
    <li>1 x pack of green tea</li>
    <li>1 x pack of peppermint tea</li>
    <li>and a shed load of 3 in 1 instant coffee sachets (24 to be precise!)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This was to accomadate for our 4 night journey on the train, with one meal a day being eaten in the on board pectobar, Russian for restuarant.

    We were worried that the journey was going to be insanely boring. However, due to jumping 5 time zones in the 5193km journey, the time went surprisingly quickly as we lost at least an hour of each day.
</p>
<p>
    To pass the time we played cards, read books, visited the resturant and slept... A LOT!! 
</p>
<p>
    During the journey Kat had aquired a slight cold so for the first two days she was happy doing nothing and sleeping it off, but to be honest we were both glad of the rest as we havent stopped for the past month, exploring and travelling our way around Europe.
</p>
<p>
    The 3 of us had the 4 berth cabin to ourselves during most of the duration, which was nice as it allowed us to stow away the 4th bed to give the impression of more room.

    We soon learnt once we were out of the suburbs of Moscow the landscape in Russia is absolutely stunning. We spent much of our time gawping out the window at the snowy trees and hillsides that our train snaked through.
</p>
<p>
    We made friends with the Russian family in the cabin next door, a 10 year old girl named Anastasia and her parents ( both Russian Police officers ). The father was originally quite intimidating, but we soon learnt that it isn't custom to smile to be polite here. But after a few hours we were soon exchanging food and talking broken English / Russian to one another while watching the scenery go past. On our last day together they aso invited us for breakfast which consisted of Rye bread with salami and cheese, it was delicous and a welcome change from our instant porridge.
</p>  
<p>
    By day 4 we were very ready to get off the train, having not moved much the last 4 days, we were itching to get off and see Lake Baikal.
</p>
<p>
    I dont think we could cope with the 8 full days from Moscow to Bejing in one sitting...
