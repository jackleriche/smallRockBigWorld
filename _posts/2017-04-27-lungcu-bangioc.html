    It’s 6am, our heads are banging, yet so is the music downstairs...Vien and Marco are already drinking the happy water (rice wine)! Time to get out of here. We headed to the local Sunday market to get stared at and for a classic breakfast of more Pho Bo (beef noodle soup), even the lady offered us rice wine (is everyone here alcoholics?) before hitting the road again. More incredible undulating between mountain top and riverside views. I swear it just keeps getting better. The roads are so quiet and good condition, apart from the odd gravel parts where they’re resurfacing.

    Stopped a few times to take some photo’s and later in the day we stopped to take a photo and realised Troublemaker’s engine was smoking (Jack’s bike). Deciding it was safer to tow him rather than try to ride it, Robert took my bike (most power, it’s a beast) and towed Jack the 14km to the next town and nearest mechanic. We wish we had a photo of this! After 3 hours at the doctors, the bike had a whole top end engine rebuild for 800,000 Dong (£28), amazing. 
</p>
<p>
    Meanwhile, Laura and I found a nice riverside place to stay in called Viet Hoang Guesthouse. 200,000 Dong per couple (£7.50) got us our own private rooms, with bathrooms, and even our bags had beds to sleep on in the rooms. So nice to not worry about rats (Vien’s farm house).

    Another ride with beautiful views (sorry it’s boring and repetitive but they truly are amazing)and good roads. More mountains with villages on plateau's again, in between dropping down to lush greenery next to the rivers. The temperature really changes too going up a down, coat on - coat off, a lot. 
</p>
<p>
    Back to a mechanics that evening, this time for a brand new wheel change for Jack to try and fix Troublemakers wobble. She got a brand new rear wheel hub, spokes and back brake. They also looked at Red Beast (Kat’s bike) as he keeps backfiring downhill. They said it’s just old and would cost too much to try and get a new Carb as they don’t stock them anymore.

    Tuyet Niem Hotel is the place that we stayed. The whole town was very busy and the other hotel was full, we were lucky to get the last 2 double rooms (250,000 Dong £8.50 p/room) in this hotel, we met some guys who came into town just after us and they couldn’t find a place to stay. Turn’s out it’s a national holiday for 4 days to celebrate the 1975 Vietnamese independence day from the war. No wonder Vien was consuming so much rice wine, or maybe he just always does?!

    Rode 50km North to spend most of the day sightseeing at the Ban Gioc Waterfalls, the largest (not tallest) in Vietnam, right on the Chinese border. They were truly spectacular, we got a raft to just below them and got hit with the spray. It was so strange to see the Chinese tourists doing the same from the other side of the river! It was very busy with Vietnamese tourists because of the national holiday. However there were barely any western tourists there, the only ones we bumped into were the lads we met in the town the night before, James, Hugo, Damien and Sam. Like in China, lots of people were also wanting photo’s of/with us here.

    It was also very hot at the waterfalls, but you’re not allowed to swim in them. Online it said you could, but they had a man with a whistle telling people off for even paddling up to their knees. We wanted a dip (the lads too), so the 8 of us headed upstream about 7km to a gentle flowing pool in the river that looked like we could swim in. It was so refreshing and great with the mountains around us, also so good to have a swim as it had been weeks! Rode the 50km back to Quang Uyen to stay in the same hotel. Good day out.
