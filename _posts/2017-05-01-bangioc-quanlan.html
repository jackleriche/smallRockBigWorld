<h4>Distance: <span>180km</span> </h4>

<p>
   Big ride today. 180km along roads with good conditions, including a little motorway section which was a bit scary (for Kat) dodging the trucks, buses and bicycles. Definitely getting hotter and stickier now that we’re leaving the mountains and getting lower down too. We had sushi on our lunch break in a little town at ‘bunny cafe’, it was so nice to have something other than Pho Bo!

    Found a guesthouse in the town of Dinh Lap for 180,000 Dong (£6) for 1 night per double room. It was very basic, but the guy had a lovely garden at the top with an amazing view or the hilltops around, and there were some brand new self-contained little shacks that I guess he’ll rent out in the future. Kat also screamed when she went into the bathroom as she saw her first Gecko! Very excited to get to the coast tomorrow, it’s been 2 months and we miss the sea so much.

    Shorter ride today, but the road conditions were very mixed. It was very bumpy to start, then we rode along big new main roads with great hillside and river views. After followed a bit of busy highway through Cua Ong over a big bridge to Cai Rong Island.

    Jack was doing a weird dance on his bike at one point, we couldn’t work out what was going on. Turned out he’d got a wasp up his shorts, so he was trying to grab it so it didn’t go any higher! He managed to kill it but it stung him on his leg when he grabbed it.

    Here we caught a 2 ½ hour ferry to Quan Lan Island. We’d read online that there were only 2 ferries a day from here, one at 7am and the other at 1pm so we got there for the latter boat. You drive right onto the pier and they carry the motorbikes onto the passenger ferry! We each paid 180,000 Dong (£6) total each for ourselves and our bikes. The journey was amazing, we got to travel through all the incredible peaks of Bai Tu Long Bay (next to Ha Long) for a fraction of the price of a ‘boat tour’ and we could sit on top of the boat in the open.

<h4>Day 12</h4>

    Arriving on the island we drove the 12km north, along the completely empty smooth main road, to ‘Minh Chau’ town. We stayed literally on the beach for 3 nights at a place called Chuyen Trang for 300,000 Dong for the 4 of us each night. That’s 75,000 Dong (£2.50) a night per person! We were sleeping in a shack and we’d given Laura and Robert the bed so we were sleeping on sunbed cushions on the floor.

    It was definitely worth the slightly sore backs to be able to run in the sea as soon as we woke up in the mornings and late at night before bed. We spend the 3 days just chilling, reading, swimming, eating and exploring the island. We also played a ‘Netherlands vs Jersey’ football match on the beach in the rain and unfortunately the Dutch won. 
</p>
<p>
    One evening we also were invited to join some locals drinking beer and rice wine, rolling around in the sand, singing and trying to chat to one another (limited Vietnamese from us and English from them!). It was lovely and relaxing on the island. There also are barely any Western tourists there and it’s still a very sleepy fishing island, which was lovely to experience. We would definitely recommend it for anyone wanting an authentic Vietnamese chill out.
