<h3>Hpa An</h3>

<h4>Transport:</h4>
<p>
    Unfortunately, the bus company had only 2 seats left to go direct from Inle Lake to Hpa An, and there were 4 of us, Jack, Lucy, Tori and I. So we decided to let the girls take the direct bus, and we would take 2 buses to get there. Their bust cost 28,000 Kyats (£18.50), on a normal bus with no reclining seats, think there was air-con though (the girls also said that it broke down and took 4 hours longer than it should!). 
</p>
<p>    
    We took an overnight 11hr bus to Bago first, 22,000 Kyats (£12) VIP (reclining comfy seats, pillows and blankets). At 5am, we got a pot noodle for breakfast at a convenience store, had a cuppa with some chickens at a local cafe, and watched some cows roam across the highway. We then took the 5hr bus to Hpa An from Bago, costing 10,000 Kyats (£5.50) each, for a coach.

<p>
    Originally, we hadn’t even planned to come to Hpa An. However, we had decided to leave Myanmar by the same border at Mae Sot (the lower border is near on impossible to cross during wet season apparently and takes a very long time in the back of a pick-up to get to), so we thought we’d stop here for a couple of days on our way out. 
</P>
<P>
    We’re pleased we did. It’s a very local town, with barely any hotels or tourists or western culture, which was nice to see the real Myanmar again after Inle Lake. The first day we all caught up on lost sleep, then we met Robert and Laura for dinner, who were also there. We went to a local place called Khit Thit, that served delicious chinese plates. We had some Myanmar beers and they were even showing the spurs game which made Jack happy.
</P>
<P>    
    On day 2, we took a 9 hour tour the next day in the back of a motorbike tuk tuk from our hotel. For 6 of us, it cost us 30,000 Kyats (£20) in total for the tuk tuk, so just over £3 each. It was jam packed visiting lots of different places. We visited a few caves, but our favourites were ‘Suddan Cave’, that you walk 1km through and see beautiful stalagmites and stalactites, before coming out the other side and taking a skinny canoe paddled by guys with one foot. It was so beautiful, you all have to lie down and squeeze through a cave with around 1 ft of head room, before popping out on the shimmering water with pinnacles all around and not a soul in sight. 
</p>
<P>
    We headed to a natural swimming pool and had lunch there, before going to see 1000 buddha statues in a field, and Kyuak Kalap Monastery built on a rock in the middle of a lake. The second cave we loved, was Yathaypyan Cave. At first sight, it looks like it just has statues inside, yet you go deeper and walk about 500m through pitch black to come out the other side at the top of a mountain with incredible views of the river. To finish off, we went to ‘Bat Cave’ and waited over an hour to watch over 4000 bats fly out over our heads at dusk. Hungry, and with sore bums from the bumpy dirt tracks, we had a ridiculously cheap Indian dinner at a place called White.

<h4>Accommodation:</h4>
<p>
    As I said earlier, few tourists come here so accommodation is limited. ‘Galaxy’, the nicest hotel with the most mod-cons, where Robert and Laura stayed, was full. So we opted for ‘Golden Sky Guesthouse’. Classically South East Asian, the outside looks brand new, but you walk in and the place is ancient (they do this a lot with buses too)! Looking a bit tired and run down, it’s budget, but in our double room the bed was comfortable, private bathroom was clean, and there was free bread and jam for breakfast. We can’t remember exactly the price, but think it was about 16,000 Kyats (£10) for the 2 of us per night.

<h3>Mae Sot / Bangkok</h3>

<h4>Transport:</h4>
<p>
    Our time has come to an end for Myanmar, our 30 day visas are up. Luckily for us the journey to the border isn’t quite so bad, 4 hours in a shared taxi, between the 4 of us, cost 50,000 Kyats (about £15 each). The car was nicer than the first, but the driving is still just as crazy. Arriving at the border we were able to exchange the rest of our Kyat’s with an English couple (its a closed currency) so that was fortunate, after we headed for the bridge. 
</p>
<p>
    Somehow we managed to get past the Myanmar immigration and not collect our exit stamps (shows how relaxed the system is), before finding out that Thailand officials would let us in without it. So walk back to get the stamps, and a walk back to get stamped in. 
</p>
<p> 
    Another unfortunate stroke of luck was the night bus to Bangkok only had two spots left, Tori and Lucy were happy to take them as we were happy to stay behind as Kat hates night buses! We grabbed a bite to eat at a nearby cafe before saying our goodbyes. (we were meeting them in Bangkok so nothing to sentimental). We got the same bus at 9am the following day costing 370 Baht (£6.50)     
</p>

<h4>What we did:</h4>
<p>
    After spending a night in Mae Sot, which we really didn't do much. Ate, watched a movie, slept, woke for 8am to get the bus. We arrived in Bangkok 9.5 hours later.
</p>
<p>
    We had two reasons to be back in Bangkok, one was for Jack to start and finish some work he had picked up and the second was to figure out what we're doing with ourselves from this point onwards. We both read ‘the railway man’ whilst we were in Myanmar so had decided we would visit Kanchanaburi next.
</p>
<p>    
    While Jack was working Kat met up with Tori and Lucy, heading to a few markets, or was found by the pool enjoying the sun.

<h4>Accommodation:</h4>
<p>
    Happy Inn cost us 400baht (£8 for the two of us), the room was huge, air con, great shower, small tv, free water. If you ever find yourself in Mae Sot and you’ve missed our Bus, go to Happy Inn.
</p>
<p>   
    2W Hostel was behind the main train station in Bangkok, so away from all the hustle and bustle of Khao San Road. The Hostel was great but was fairly pricey at 400 Baht a night per person. But it was clean, and quiet had great internet and the cafe was awesome (albeit a little pricey too).
</p>
<p>    
    The AirBnB we got was 15km out of the centre, but that was fine. We had access to a brand new gym, and a 50m swimming pool. We were on the 38th floor and our bedroom had full length windows overlooking the Bangkok skyline.
