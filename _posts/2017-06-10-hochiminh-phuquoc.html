    Dull drive to start, then got much better after lunch. We rode 180km across bridges and past rivers, once we were out of the suburbs, onto barges too it was great. We arrived at Can Tho, a surprisingly big city with high-rises, but we found a nice hotel ‘Au Binh Hotel’ just outside the city where we had dinner and slept for 350,000 Dong (£12) for a triple room and breakfast.

    We rode a nice 90km over bridges and past rivers to Rach Gia, where there are fast ferry’s to Phu Quoc, however all of them were full and they said we couldn’t get a boat for 4 days! Deciding that this was out of the question, we rode another 70km to Ha Tien along the most boring, bumpy main road with houses and shops either side of the road. 
</p>
<p>
    We were so down coming into the city, thinking we’d missed the 4pm boat, but luck was on our side. We saw another terminal and decided to see if any boats were going from there. A car ferry was docked and was leaving to the island in 10 mins! We quickly paid 260,000 Dong (£9) each for ourselves and our motorbikes and drove onto the boat. 
</p>
<p>
    The crossing was great, the sea was slight, Adel said ‘the waves are so big!’ She’s only ever seen the sea 3 times to be fair. It took 3 hours but air-con inside with new seats and a bar (no alcohol consumed of course as we were driving off). Then we got to Phu Quoc Island on the other side of our hostel and had to drive the easy 22km on quiet main roads to ‘Phu Quoc Backpackers’.

    Kat woke up early the next day and walked down the road onto the beach before having a dip. The hostel was in between resorts, and unfortunately also right next to 2 big building sites which were a bit noisy during the day, but we were mainly on the beach. We met an English girl called Rhiannon and spent the first day chilling on the beach, playing in the sea, and Kat taught Adel how to surf on a paddle board.
</p>
<p>
    The second day was a rainy day, so we decided to get all 3 bikes fixed, washed and Adel and Jack did paint jobs on Anastasia (Adel’s bike) and Trouble Maker became Pegasus, as Kat painted on some silver wings after Jack had sanded and spray painted her fuel tank black. 
</p>
<p>    
    The third day we decided to explore the island a bit more. So we went to coconut prison, where Southern Vietnamese held Northern Vietnamese and the Viet Kong as prisoner’s of war and some awful torture happened. After that we went to Sao beach for a quick dip, it was full of tourists, boats and jellyfish, so we went to another beach along and saw a nice big temple. 
</p>
<p> 
    Later, we visited the waterfall on the edge of the giant national park. When we arrived, it was very busy and full of people playing loud music and chilling in the water. We hiked 1km up to the main falls and jumped into the pool under the waterfall. After the walk up it was so nice and refreshing, the water’s about 20 degrees and felt so nice. 
</p>
<p>
    The last 2 days we chilled on the beach and swam a lot. Jack got heat stroke too, so he needed to spend a day resting and rehydrating. Phu Quoc Backpackers was a really chilled place to stay. It only cost us 135,000 Dong (£4.50) a day each for a dorm bed and breakfast was included. It was run by 2 Vietnamese girls and they were so lovely also, happy to help and give advice, they also helped book tours if people want them.
