    I'm sure you've all heard the statistics about motorcycling in Vietnam (good old Top Gear), but the majority of accidents happen when people are; 1) Drunk 2) Not wearing a helmet (or proper one) 3) Are driving like wreckless idiots...So, we decided that if we were going to do this, we would try our best to avoid harming ourselves by; 1) NEVER drinking (whilst driving of course not full stop, thats obsurd) 2) Bought proper helmets 3) Drive slowly, safely and never at night.

<h3>Day 1</h3>

<h4>Distance: <span>187km</span> </h4>

<p>
    Shitting ourselves, we barely slept all night both thinking we were going to die, we nearly piked it at and told Robert and Laura we weren't coming at 6am when they woke. However, after some consideration, we decided we would at least try to drive out of the city and maybe even to Sapa and if we hated it we could always come straight back to Hanoi to sell the bikes. 
</p>
<p>
    After the first terrifying 2 hours of morning city traffic with no rules, followed by a short stint of motorway, we were hating it and almost turned back. But then we went on to the beautiful QL32 road, ahhh it was bliss! Road conditions were great, there was barely any traffic as they all take the highway, and the scenery was incredible. Mountains, hills, rivers and rice paddy fields. The sense of freedom was amazing too, being able to stop when we like and go wherever we wanted.

    Mechanics all along the way, cafe's, snack shops, restaurants and nha nghi's, which are motels/guest houses/hotels/homestays, everywhere 30km at least. We felt happy that should there be a problem, there is always help nearby. Found a hotel to stay in overnight for the 4 of us in 1 room in a town called Thi Xa Ngha for 550,000 in total for 4 of us (£20ish so £5ish each)

    More breathtaking views. We started to climb higher into the mountians now, literally riding through the clouds passing little vilages with children waving shouting 'hello'. They seemed so intrigued and happy to see us driving through their villages.

    The road conditions were good to start, then it got a little bumpier and more gravel patches on the windy climbs and drops, so needed to keep our eyes open more on the road. Ended up deciding to stop in a town called Than Uyen at a motel. Went out for dinner and with our limited Vietnamese, Kat ordered some fried rice. It came with just egg and beans and the boys moaned that it wasn't enough. So Jack said he would order some Chicken fried rice, asked the lady, and she ended up bringing him and Robert more egg, bean fried rice, it was hilarious.

<h4>Day 3</h4>

<h4>Distance: <span>98km</span> </h4>
<p>
    We ended up staying an extra day in Than Uyen because Robert wasn't feeling good. It also was chucking it down with rain, so we decided to spend the day sorting things out. Jack went back to a mechanic and using google translate he asked us 'let's go for a shower' and said 'I love you', we couldn't work out if it was the translate or the guy having us on! Jack also had a roadside £1.80 hair cut, then we bought a giant tarpolin (about 20ft X 20ft) and made our own bag/bike covers, poncho's and Jack made wet trousers using duct tape at the seems. It was actually so much fun, felt like an art attack day!

<p>
    Back on the road the next day, we headed to Sapa. We had to wear all our layers as it's actually cold up here! Gone from 36 degrees in Hanoi to 8 degrees in the pouring rain. Despite the rain, the drive was still amazing. Again we rode through the clouds winding up and down mountains through the 'Tram Ton Pass' also known as 'Heaven's Gate' and we could see why, riding 2,500m high through the clouds into sunshine to see the 'Silver Falls' giant waterfall that looks like it's falling from the sky, words just don't do it justice. Down into Sapa we stayed at a hotel called 'Sapa Glory Hotel' in another 4 person room for 165,000 Dong (£5.50) for 1 night each including a delicious breakfast with yummy coffee and banana pancakes.
