<h3>Pamiers - Ax les Thermes - Lyon</h3> 
<p><time>06:00</time> we arrive in Toulouse and get the hour train to Pamiers, the next few nights we're staying at Kats family friends, Jo and Rick's house</p>
<p>Due to us arriving a little early, we had a 'petite dejuner' at the hotel opposite the train station, as we sit down waiting for the menu to arrive, we were pleasently surprised when the waiter brought out freash croisants, orange juice and coffee with a selection of jams, after paying up and then asking where Jo's street was, expecting to walk there, She walks through the door to pick us up</p>
<p>
    Dropping off our packs and saying hello to Rick, we headed in the car to Ax les Thermes ski resort with Jo. Its was quite quiet, despite it being the french half term, due to the cloudy weather.</p>
<p>
    We hired ski's, boards and boots from the town at skimium, the shop provided us with fairly decent gear. At the bottom of the gondola we were about to queue for a half day pass when we were approached by a couple of skiers selling their day passes for 15euros, saving us around 15euros and giving us an extra 30 mins on the slopes.
    Snow conditions were great, due to fresh snow the day before, however the visibility was very poor and half the lifts and runs were closed.
    Overall we had a good day, but it left us wanting more! Maybe tomorrow?
</p>
<p>
    Arriving back to Jo and Rick's alittle exhausted from the lack of sleep and skiing, we had a nice evening eating home made curry, drinking wine/beer and reminising on old times in Jersey.

<h4>Day 2</h4>
<p>catching up on lost sleep, we had a lie in. Today was a drizzly day too, so we used this opportunity to book our onward trip to Veice and Slovenia.</p>
<p>Headed into Pamier in the afternoon, had a walk around the park, the town was quiet sleepy town in the ?!?!?!Pyrinees?!?!, typically french, not many locals spoke English, so Kat had to crack out the French for us to get post cards and letters, again not much exciing but plelasent none the less</p>
<p> That evening Jo's son Jono and his girlfriend Tanny came from Toulouse to spend the evening with us, for the occasion we went to an all-you-can-eat Chinese restaurant.</p>

<h4>Day 3</h4>
<p>
    Great weather for a ski!! Checking the webcams and conditions it was glorious blue skys and sunshine. Today was our last day in Pamier but we had decided to give Ax another shot before we left France. Taking our packs with us, Rick drove us to the slopes where we went back to the same hire place, hiring the same gear again we set off for the gondola
</p>
<h5>EVERYONE AND THEIR GRAN IS HERE!!!</h5>
<p>
    Baring in mind we only had time for half a day, due to our trains leaving Ax to Toulouse, the queue for the gondola took us 1h30m, we had thought about leaving the queue and forgetting about the ski, but we persisted through and glad we did, snow was just great, once we were up the mountain the slopes were quiet and we managed to fit in a couple of hours of greeat skiing, we did have a small panic when Kat turned down the wrong slope which added another 20 mins to our already tight shedule but we made it none the less.
</p>
<p>
    Mad rush to skimium, to return our stuff, before legging it to the train station, luckily we arrived with 2 mins to spare, onwards to Toulouse, where we had a forward train to Lyon, arriving at Lyon for 10pm, we had our Flixbus to Venice at 1:15am
