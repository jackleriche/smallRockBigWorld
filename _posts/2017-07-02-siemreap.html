<h3>Siem Reap</h3>

<h4>Transport</h4>

<p>
    Our journey out of Koh Rong Sanloem was more successful then the journey in, still very sweaty but the ground was dry so no mishaps.
</p>
<p>
    We boarded the 1pm boat back to Sihanoukville, thinking we would have to stay a night we grabbed a bite to eat before heading to Giant Ibis to book a bus to Siem Reap the following day. Turns out that one was leaving ten minutes after we got there, so hopped on a minibus for $11pp to Phnom Penh then an overnight sleeper for $15pp to Siem Reap. Glad because Sihanoukville looks a bit sleezy. 
</p>
<p>
    Mini bus was ok, flying on the roads until we hit the suburbs of Phnom Penh, then a slow hour or so until we reached the bus terminal. Sleeper was great, toilet, lying down double bunk beds, fine for Kat and I, may be strange if it was a random next to you?!? Both of us slept surprisingly well, still prefer trains. 
</p>
<p>
    Arrived in Siem reap at 5am, tuk tuk to our guest house ‘Garden Village’  as advised by the Dutch.

<p>
    As we arrived early, and couldn't check in yet ( understandable ), we decided to go to Angkor Wat. We called our tuk tuk driver from earlier and headed out for 7am, Angkor Wat entry was $37 each and the driver cost $15 for the day. You can also get 3 and 5 day passes, but 1 day is enough to do the petite loop. 
</p>
<p>
    The temples are simply breathtaking, we visited 6, the main ‘Angkor Wat’ was very busy. But the lesser visited temples of ‘Bayon’ and ‘Ta Prohm’ were our favorites. It was a great experience to see the temples, but $37 is a lot of money, we’ve heard that the site is actually owned by Vietnam as a gift from Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge leadership was destroyed. So all profits go to Vietnam. 
</p>
<p>
    Met Lucy and Rachael along pub street, few beers and then off to the ‘Phare - the Cambodian circus’. Great show, called ‘same same - but different’ makes fun of tourists in Cambodia, but very light hearted with some amazing stunts and acrobatics. No animals either, and all profits go to charitable causes, mainly teaching children the circus arts. Entry was $18pp and worth every cent.
</p>
<p>
    Kat went for a thai massage, from one of the many parlours along the main road. ½ price as it was low season, so $5 for an hour.

    ‘Garden Village guesthouse and pool’ is a great place to meet other travellers. Offering a large pool with 24hour bar. The dorms we stayed in were great, quite far from the bar so we couldn’t hear the parties when we wanted to retire to bed. The restaurant there served good food, and the staff very friendly. Its location is fairly central in Siem Reap and about a 5 minute walk from Bar street. Quite cheap too which is always a bonus.
