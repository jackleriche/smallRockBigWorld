<h3>Hanoi</h3>

<p>
    Leaving China for a second time we had two options, the overnight sleeper train or the 7 hour bus journey which left 7:00am, 7:45am, 8:00am, 9:00am and 10:20am.
</p>
<p>
    We would have preffered to get the overnight sleeper train as it removes any confussion as to where to go and what to do, plus weve already done 3 border crossings via train. But unfortunately the trian from Nanning to Hanoi is pretty popular and the next available slot was 5 days away. So bus it was!
</p>
<p>
    We opted for the 7:45am bus, thinking it would miss the worst of the morning traffic in Nanning, which it did. On depature we were handed a small bag of goodies, water, sweet bread and an apple for breakfast. 
</p>
<p>
    The journey to the border took 3.5 hours, so we mainy read, slept and gazed out the window, once we were at the border ( the friendship pass ) there was <bold>A LOT</bold> of confussion as to what happened next, people trying to convert Yuan to Dong for a ridiculous price, sellers offering taxi services etc. Luckily we were approached by a Chinese University Director who helped translate and guide us through the process, after of course he offered us jobs next year to teach English
</p>
<p>
    After waiting for around 30-45 minutes for another bus full of people to arrive, we were then put on another bus for a 5 minute journey to the border control... Had we of known we would have just walked... anyway, an hour turn around in the border crossing and we found ourselves in Vietnam.
</p>
<p>
    Another bus waiting outside for us, and we were heading to Hanoi. Taking rouoghly again 3.5 hours to arrive, dropping us off on the side of the road, where we were bombarded with taxi drivers. Seeing as neither of us had a clue where we were heading, we agreed to jump in one, costing 440,000 dong ( £15 ), pretty sure we were taken for a ride, but o well, he got us to our Hostel

<h3>Stuff we did</h3>

<p>
    On the first night in Hanoi, we took full advantage of the free beer offered from 6pm until the keg ran out at the hostel. Chatting to a couple of people in the social area, Kevin and Will, two Americans. Deciding that we needed to celebrate our birthdays, it was also Kevin's birthday on the 16th, we headed out for 'beer street' and brought along another guy named Marcus. Beers in Vietnam are ridiculously cheep, we were paying 15,000 Dong ( £0.50p ) per bottle of beer, and we took full advantage of it. After a few beers were drunk, and the street closed we headeed back to the hostel, more beers untl 3am. 
</p>
<p>
    Our second day in Hanoi, was lazy, waking up at 9am to get the free breakfast then heading straight back to bed. We left the hostel at around midday to grab a bite to eat with Kevin and Marcus, Bhan Mi, meat filled baguettes. Great to eat some bread again, so ordered two each!
</p>
<p>
    Hanoi old town is littered with cafe's, resturants, and fake clothes stores. We needed to grab a few things, a data sim, from two different providers to maximise our chance of coverage in different parts of Vietnam and of couorse to find a bike shop. Viettel had good reviews for coverage and at a reasonable price, 150,000D ( £5 ) for a 10gb data sim, and Kat went for Vinaphone which offered 3gb for 100,000D ( £3.60 ).
</p>
<p>
    The bikes was a different story, we chose the worst day to go lookking for them, in a staggering 34c heat, our phones said real feel 48c, we took ourselves on an hour walk to the street with bike shops, after having a quick look at prices, around 5.5million Dong ( £200 ) for what was essentially a commuter with front forks. We had to leave and have a think, we're both melting in this heat, both feeling rather deflated by the idea of cycling. Headed back to the Hostel for free beers..
</p>

<p>
    A new idea has arisen, Motorbikes, apparently the best way to explore Vietnam, according to people in the Hostel. Both of us have had bikes, Jack for 5 years, Kat for 1 year, how hard could it be?
</p>
<p>
    Most people who explore via motorbike do so from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi or vice versa, and sell for around $200. These bikes have had some tough lives, going up and down the country endlessly with a passenger (sometime two) and packs. So dont expect too much from them unless you pay over $400, saying that though, be sure to check the essentials, electrics, brakes, wheels etc. We ended up with a Yamaha Nouvo moped for Kat costing $230 and a Honda Win copy costing $180 for Jack. Knowing that Jacks needed some work the price was reduced to cover the costs
</p>
<p>
    Both bikes came with locks and helmets, however the helmets were not great, if we were doing this we were doing it as safely as possible, so we headed out into town to purchase new helmets, we ended up with some <i>Arai</i> copies called </i>'Andres'</i> for 1,500,000 Dong ( £50 ) for the pair.
</p>
<p>
    We had met a Dutch couple, Robert and Laura, who like us were planning on travelling via motorbike. A plan was agreed to go to Sapa first and do the north loop before deciding if we sould continue further south and down to Ho Chi Minh
</p>
<p>
    We head out at 6am to try and miss most of the busy city traffic...

<h4>Hostel</h4>

<p>
    Hanoi city backpackers, cheap, cheerful and free stuff. Weirdly they offer double bed dorms, but that actually reduced the price for a couple. We paid 335,000D ( £10 ) a night for both of us. There were cheaper options, but it would have been single bed dorms and no free beer / breakfasts so we opted to pay slightly more.
</p>
<p>
    Hostel was really nice, staff friendly and welcoming. Rooms were very clean, showers fine. The beer was also good and the breakfasts were exceptional. Kat having banana pancakes most mornings while Jack opted for the more traditional scrambled eggs on toast. Vietnamese coffee is also fantastic, strong and not for the faint hearted but good none the less.

    For the course of Vietnam, we will be introducing motorcycle diaries. Which will include the route taken plus information on road conditions and of course pictures
