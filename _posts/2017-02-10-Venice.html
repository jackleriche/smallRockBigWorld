    We arrived in Lyon after our ski at around 10pm, starving and everywhere was shut, Kat was getting HANGRY!! luckily we found a local delecasy restuarant that was Burger King in the shopping mall
</p>
<p>
    After a 3 hour wait we boarded onto <a hre="http://www.flixbux.com">Flixbus</a> at 1:15am for our 11h 30m coach journey to Venice, getting on too the bus it was completely full and stifflingly warm, we were unfortunate to not be able to sit with one another but after a few stops and into the Italian side of the Alps more seats became available. This bus although busier was actually more comfortable then the first, and while Kat didnt get much sleep, Jack on the other hand managed around 6 hours

    While we were approaching Venice at <time>12:00</time> it was almost like driving to Atlantis, neither of us quite realised how low to the water the city is. Once we arrived at the bus stop is was about a 30 min walk to our Hostel

    Venice is a truely beautiful city, you can see why it is called the city of love. It is also however very easy to get truely and utterly LOST in all the tiny alleyways, we had to refer to Google maps on multiple occasions to get around effeciently
</p>
<p>
    There is a lot of things to do in Venice, from visiting cathedrals, to lookking in Leonardo de Vinci museums. We were actually fortunate enough to arrive at the beginning of the largest <a href="">carnival</a> venice has to offer, which runs for an impressive 3 weeks from the 11th of Feb all the way to the beginning of Lent, this Carnival brings in alot of weird and wonderful sites, such as mascerade masks worn by the public and tourists, a ball happens everyday which brings out people dressed in 1600's ball attire. Unfortunately we were there for only the start but something happens every day and the <a href="">events list</a>
</p>
<p>
    We spent alot of our time in Venice exporing the lanes and entering the free and paid attractions to get a feel for the history of the City

    We had prepared ourselves for the worst with the hostel, as it had a 6.2 rating on <a href="http://www.booking.com">www.Booking.com</a>, it was relatively cheap considering its location, which was deadd center of venice working out at about Â£16 per night per person, which given the surrouonding Hotel / Hostel prices was an absolute bargin.</p>
<p>
    Now I'm not going to say it was a dump, but it wasn't the best place but it was also worth its price, the dorms were 4 man, we shared with 2 other girls, one from Vienna and the other from Moscow
</p>
<p>
    Security seemed decent, there was a decent sized bathroom, although no toilet seat... and the staff were MIA most of the time. But what can you expect for such a cheap price for Venice
