    Second day in Sapa we went for a walk to Cat Cat. It's a nice river path and shows traditional waterwheels and Vietnamese dances, but it was quite a tourist trap as you have to pay to do the trail and see the waterfall at the end. We managed to see the rice paddies in the sunshine also, which apparently is rare as it's foggy/raining and cloudy the majority of the time here.

<h3>Day 4</h3>

<h4>Distance: <span>140km</span> </h4>

<p>
    On the road again, heading North East through 'Bac Ha'. More mountain riding with beautiful scenery. The weather had brightened up a bit too so the temperature rose again and it ended up being a hot day.

    We decided to take a little 'white' road on the map rather than the long way around to Ha Giang. This ended up being a very rocky dirt track on the side of a mountain which was very bumpy, slow and a little terrifying for Kat on the moped as it was easy for Jack's Honda Win (copy) to take on the terrain. 
</p>
<p>
    Exhausted, we decided to stop straight after that road. Jack needed a mechanic too...again! Found a place to stay called Ngoc Son Hotel for 4 of us in 1 room for 400,000 Dong (£13.50) in total.

<h3>Day 5</h3>

    Bit of an argument in the morning between us and the owner of the motel about laundry. She charged us 455,000 Dong, that's £15 which is insanely expensive for here! The lady would not back down though and took Roberts helmet so he couldn't leave so we ended up paying her 350,000 (£12) still ridiculous. 
</p>
<p>
    The road was much easier than the last. Bright red paddy fields, waterfalls and rivers we passed and would stop occasionally to enjoy the view and take some photos. The final part of the day we rode 40km on the easy motorway, it wasn't too busy and we made up for lost time the day before.

<p>
    This time we decided to stay in a 'home stay' just outside of the city called Chang Village Homestay for 50,000 Dong (£1.70) each! They are just a big house with an open plan floor upstairs usually, where they put down mats for you to sleep on with covers and a mosquito net over you. It all looked pretty new also, the bathrooms were nice and it was great to sleep somewhere different. The lovely owner also let us use his powerwasher to clean our bikes.

    Long day on the bikes but the views were definitely worth it. This ride is part of the 'Northern Loop' made famous by 'Vietnam Coracle', for being the most beautiful rides through all of Vietnam. Out of Ha Giang we climbed into the mountain tops, where there were tribe villages, fields and farms settled into the plateaus. It was unreal, like something out of a film.
</p>
<p>
    We rode to the most northern village in Vietnam where there is a huge flag tower that we climbed. You could see so far around and even into China from the top, it was really cool. En route we saw some backpackers on the side of the road. They were going to the 'illegal' un-patrolled Chinese border which was only 50m off this road. We had some fun jumping from one side to the other and under the barbed wire fence into China.

<p>
    On the way to the 'Flag Tower' we found a road sign for another home stay. This one was a fully functional farm and for 40,000 Dong (£1.40) each we were sleeping above a barn on the floor, and could hear the cows, chickens and Vien's music from 5am! Vien is the guy who runs the homestay part of the farm, and he is bonkers! We joined the family for dinner, alongside a Medieran traveller Marco, and drank copious amounts of local 'rice wine' which is very lethal.
