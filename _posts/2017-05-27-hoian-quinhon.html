<h3>Day 37</h3>

<h4>Distance: <span>284km</span> </h4>

    A ridiculously long drive today, 284km, the longest drive yet and it sure felt like it, especially as it was pouring down! Nobody was in the best mood afterwards, as we were pretty soaked. We opted to head back onto the Ho Chi Minh Trail as the views are stunning and the roads less busy, and it didn't disappoint. Large amounts of jungle again, cruising past sleepy villages in between mountains.

    We arrived in Kon Tum drenched and went to ‘Eva Cafe’, for a coffee to warm up and meet ‘Mr Anh’, thank’s to Panch’s advice. He advised we stay at a local hotel called ‘Konklor Hotel’ and got a special discount just for mentioning his name. For 180,000 Dong (£6), per couple you get your own little detached double room and bathroom with a TV and they were really nice.  We had a set menu dinner each for 45,000 Dong (£1.50), which was delicious too, thanks again Panch :)

    Another big drive today, but at least it wasn’t raining. Kat’s bike had a puncture, so it was patched up for 10,000 Dong (35p), and we were off. We took a tiny little DT road (B roads at home), which despite not being in a great condition as there were so many potholes, it was a really nice route through tribes villages and past old abandoned buildings from the war. Back onto the QL19 after 30km ish which was lovely and smooth, then bumpy, then smooth again and so on. More amazing views and a great windy hill to fly down.

<p>
    Driving through Qui Nhon, we headed over a gigantic bridge (it was at least 2km long). After that you arrive at Nhon Hai peninsular and after the bridge it’s like a ghost town, lots of sandpits and big new roads leading nowhere. We went up a small road over the hill and arrived in Nhon Hai’s little fishing village on the coast. The only place to stay there is newly built 6 months old Nhon Hai Backpackers, literally on the beach, owned and run by Lee, a local guy, and his family.

<p>
    It is so lovely here, the only tourists are the handful of people in the backpackers, and the bay is full of locals fishing boats and children playing (on school holidays). We spent most of our 3 days here swimming too and snorkelling at the reef 100m out to sea, reading, chilling, and chatting with Lee’s family and other travellers. 
</p>
<p>
    Lee offers a bbq with the family if there are enough residents in the backpackers, luckily there was and the spread was fantastic, loads of prawn spring rolls, fish, amazing pork skewers, rice etc. Well worth the 100,000d ( £2.33 ).
