	<h3>HOOOOORRRRRAAAAA!!! we've left</h3>
	<p>albeit two days later then originally booked (our first boat was cancelled) , but we have finally got on board the condor and we are heading to France!</p>
	<p>OK so the 4 hour journey to our neighbouring port town in France was a bit longer then expected due to the Condor Rapide running on three engines rather then four, but we landed in St Malo at 11:00pm, headed to the taxi rank to go to our Hotel for the night, after waiting around 5 mins in an empty car park we decided the walkk would do us good!</p>
	<p>As we got to the old town, we walked past a what seemed abadoned fair ground, bit creepy, bags already starting to ache, we still had 25 minutes of our 30 minute journey!</p>
	<p>Approaching the first round about, was it straight on or right to our hotel?! Luckily we met a nice woman who helped us on our way. Finding out she too had travelled, ( eastern europe in a van ), we had nothing much more to talk about then the obvious... Brexit. She departed shortly after into the midst of a trading estate and we went on about our way</p>


	<p>The Hotel which we booked at the harbour terminal prior to leaving (didnt want to take any chcances of the condor not going), was small but tidy, had all the usual things yuo'd find in a travel lodge, check in closes at 9pm but luckily Kat had told her of our delay and she was more then happy to stay on untill we arrived</p>

	<h3>Day 1: St malo</h3>
	<p>So when people ask, "hey, so where's the first stop, Thailand, Hong Kong, OZ?", they look bermused when I say "nah, condor to St. Malo". I guess people aren't used to the idea of a round the world trip being via train</p>
