	<h3>HOOOOORRRRRAAAAA!!! we've left</h3> 
	<p>Albeit two days later then originally booked (our first boat was cancelled), but we have finally got on board the condor and we are heading to France!</p>
	<p>OK so the 4 hour journey to our neighbouring port town in France was a bit longer then expected due to the Condor Rapide running on three engines rather then four, but we landed in St Malo at 11:00pm, headed to the taxi rank to go to our Hotel for the night, after waiting around 5 mins in an empty car park we decided the walk would do us good!</p>

	<p>As we got to the old town, we walked past a what seemed abadoned fair ground, bit creepy, bags already starting to ache, we still had 25 minutes of our 30 minute journey!</p>
	<p>Approaching the first round about, was it straight on or right to our hotel?! Luckily we met a nice woman who helped us on our way. Finding out she too had travelled, ( eastern europe in a van ), we had nothing much more to talk about then the obvious... Brexit. She departed shortly after into the midst of a trading estate and we went on about our way</p>

	

	<p>The <a href="http://www.hoteldeleurope-saintmalo.com/">Hotel de l'Europe</a> which we booked at the harbour terminal prior to leaving (didnt want to take any chcances of the condor not going), was small but tidy, had all the usual things you'd find in a travel lodge, check in closes at 9pm but luckily Kat had told her of our delay and she was more then happy to stay on untill we arrived</p>

	<h3>St malo</h3>

		As it's February and out of season it was very quiet and a lot of cafes, restaurants and hotels were closed for buisiness or refurbishment. We had our big packs with us and due to security in France there are no lockers in train stations or in the information centre. However, the lady in the information centre, located just outside the walls, suggested that we go to <a href="http://www.hoteldeuniverssaintmalo.com/">Hotel de L'Univers</a> and buy a drink, then we could leave our luggage there all day in their 'baggery' (it is not locked). The rest of the day was spent meandering around the historical walls getting our learn on. I never knew that the man who 'found' Canada was from St. Malo and is burried in their cathedral.

		As we were delayed getting to France, we decided to miss out Paris and actually found a direct bus overnight from St. Malo to Toulouse rather than the trains. We found the app <a href='http://www.goeuro.com'>GoEuro</a> which found the <a href='http://www.flixbus.com'>Flixbus</a> that cost only 20 Euros each and took 10 1/2 hours, instead of a train via Paris to Toulouse that would have cost 120 Euros each. Addmittedly, the coach is no luxury and we had little sleep (especially Kat the princess), but the seats recline, there is a toilet on board which is all you need as a budgeting traveller (unless you're Jack and 6ft6 and can't fit in the toilet!) and the bus has 4g wifi on board which is free to use.
