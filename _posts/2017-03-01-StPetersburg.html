    Arriving to St. Petersburg was fairly straight forward. We had also booked these tickets way in advance with <a href='http://www.realrussia.com'>Real Russia</a>, who again were nothing but exceptional in preordering and delivery of our tickets before we left.

    Another night in a sleeper train to St. Petersburg. This time we knew the border control were coming, but that didnt make us sleep any better. After they arrived it was 00:30, and then we had the loud process of wheel changing, yes thats right, they physically change the wheels on the trains to accomodate for Russian tracks! Jack stayed up for over 2 hours watching the whole process. Not much sleep was had and we arrived in St. Petersburg for 7am

    After arriving at Saint Petersburg at 7am, we decided to head straight to the Hostel after confirming that this was OK the day before via Email. On route we picked up a croisant and coffee from one of the local bakeries.

    We arrived at Baby Lemonade Hostel at around 8:30am dropping our bags off and speaking to the lovely staff there. We were told about a few spots to visit, also met Emma who wil be joining us on our Vodka Train journey. To break the ice we decided to head out for a stroll before meeting out Honcho at 5pm at the Hostel.

    5pm and our Honcho Diana arrived to kick our journey off. After the usual forms were filled out she suggested that we watch the Swan Lake ballet at the Marinski Theater, as it was on tonight with a few spots available for relatively cheap. We quickly went out for a bite to eat, then headed out for the ballet. We had paid for a box the closest to the stage on the left. Jack done well not to fall asleep while Kat loved every minute of it. Prices for our tickets cost 5000 rubles each, which cost in the region of Â£60, but prices can range from 2000 to 20000rubles depending on location. Word of advice, if attending a theater, do make an effort in your clothing, we were told about this but decided to just go as we were, and felt so underdressed during the play to almost embarrasment

    Diana arrived at our Hostel at 10am to give us a walking tour of St Petersburg, we had previously walked most of the sites the day earlier however we didnt really know any of the history or what we were looking at. Diana's knowledge for St. Petersburg was fantasic and her english is great! We also visited the Hermitage, which was free ( every first Thursday of the month ), great collection of art with a wide variety to look at, we only had 3 hours, but you could easily spend the day there. A must see, with the collection only growing larger in the comming years.

    Baby lemonade is listed in the Lonely Planet's Trans Siberian book that Kat has and it didn't disapoint! It was a mix between what Castle 1004 ( Slovenia ) and Essential Hostel ( Budapest ) had to offer! Great dorms, we were in an 8 man, but with privacy blinds for the lower bunks. Security lockers were free and a fantasic open chill out lounge which had a good vibe. The theme for the hostel is 60's theme with all the rooms named after famous artists / songs in that era, we stayed in 'yellow submarine'. As it was off season there was some minor renovation work going on but on the whole it wasn't obtrusive at all. The staff are so pleasent and allowed us to leave our bags after check out for a full day as well as chill for 30 mins before our taxi lift to the train station at 9pm
