    Eat, sleep, read, repeat...another overnight journey heading South-West from Chengdu. There are no direct trains, so we took a 23hr overnight hard-sleeper train to Huaihua first, before changing there onto a 4 hour hard seat train to Zhangjiajie. The total of this journey cost us only around 230 Yuan (£26). 
</p>
<p>
    The views were amazing, from high up on the tracks over bridges and in between tunnels we saw lots of paddy and mustard fields being farmed by hand, with rivers and mountains in between.  
</p>
<p>
    We arrived into Zhangjiajie city after 7pm, which unfortunately meant we’d missed the last bus to Zhonghua, the town closest our hotel and the national park entrance. On the hotel’s site though they can do pick up for 150 Yuan, and a taxi cost 200 Yuan, so we called and took them up on this offer for the hour’s drive there from the train station.

<h3>Stuff we did</h3>

<p>
    The infamous ‘Avatar’ floating hallelujah mountains, are what we came to see in Zhangjiajie National Park. After a rest day following the train journey, as it was such a miserable day, we went into the park for the next 2 days. Tickets cost 245 Yuan for a 4 day ticket, as you cannot buy individual day tickets. However, if you want to see the park at a more leisurely pace, we would suggest you do take at least 3, maybe even 4, days to see it all.  
</p>
<p>
    The views were absolutely spectacular. We started off by walking along the ‘Golden Whip Stream’, you can see the mountains towering above and also saw monkeys, one of which stole a woman’s food! Then we climbed an hour’s 1000m ascent hike up steps to the ‘Avatar Mountain’. The walk was so quiet, but once up there it was so busy with tourists. It’s the main attraction of the park plus you can get there by lifts and bus so it got a little overwhelming being pushed and shoved near barriers when you’re overhanging some ridiculous heights, Kat got a little claustrophobic, plus her fear of heights didn’t help her. Descended down again and walked to the hotel for a well deserved beer and dinner with sore legs.
</p>
<p>
    On the second day we headed to the Tianzishan Mountain, it was incredibly busy here too as buses can get there with ease, so we only stayed for about 15mins. Our advice would be not to bother with here if you’re only in the park for 1 or 2 days. We then walked down another mountain to make our way to Huangshi Village, legs very sore so we treated ourself to a cable car which had a glass bottom which was pretty scary. The slogan here is ‘not visiting Huangshizhai is equivalent to not visiting Zhangjiajie’ and we can see why. It was so beautiful up there, the sights of the mountains were magnificent and it was lovely and quiet with barely any tourists as they all stick to Avatar or Tianzishan Mountain. We spent about 2 hours walking around the whole ancient village mountain, which had around 20 viewing platforms to see the sandstone peak forests on top of the sheer mountains around. 
</p>
<p>
    On our last day, we were going to head to Tianmen Mountain to walk the glass walkway, which is a 100 meter, 1400 meters high walkway clinging around the mountain. However it is expensive, another 270 Yuan and by the time we arrived in Zhangjiajie after our 3 hour bus ride, we didn’t have the time either. We did as much as we could in the 2 days, which was most of it, however we were out all day and walking a lot of steps and hills to do it as cheaply as possible as all the lifts cost around 70 Yuan one way, if we took them all it would have been expensive!

<p>
    Wulingyuan MINI Inn was where we stayed for our 4 nights. Originally we had only booked 2 nights, but loved it, and after the rainy day in decided to stay another 2 nights. The first room was a king double room, with an en suite bathroom, for only 196 Yuan (£23) for the two of us for two nights. However, we could hear the boiler all night and it kept us up a lot, plus that room was booked for the following 2 nights, so we had to upgrade to a room with a balcony. This was much better, the only noise were the birds and cockerels outside in the mornings. It was much more pricy at 316 Yuan (£36), but it was so worth it for the view of the incredible mountains with a beer in hand at the end of the day!
</p>
<p>
    The hotel is also located only 300m away from the National Park entrance, which was brilliant. It’s also well away from the city, which is just what we wanted. We ate traditional chinese meals there for 35 Yuan (£4) each an evening which were delicious and great to be at the hotel as we were so exhausted after the full days out walking. The staff were also so lovely, it’s a family run hotel and the youngest son speaks English and was so helpful, he even booked our train tickets online for us with his Chinese login (you can’t book them if you’re foreign!).
