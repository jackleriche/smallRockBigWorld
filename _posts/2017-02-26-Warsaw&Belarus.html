<h3>Warsaw and Belarus</h3>

<h4>Transport</h4>

<p>
    From Krakow to Warsaw, we had the option of a slightly cheaper but slightly longer ( 4.5 hours ) <a href='http://www.polskibus.com'>Polski Bus</a>, or the slightly more expensive, quicker ( 3 hour ) train. We opted for the latter as it also provided us with a better time to set off and arrive. We done some research and decided to go in to the station to book, luckily we did as we soon found out the the trains we had originally planned to get didnt have any seats left, luckily the woman at the desk found us a cheaper train which was a special weekend only deal which worked out at 90Zlotys ( roughly £18 ) for the both of us. The train journey was on a double decker train, which was also very busy, we ended up getting there a little late and were left with fold down seats, so word of advice is to arrive 20min+ earlier.

    We had booked our journey to belarus months ago with <a href='http://www.realrussia.com'>Real Russia</a>, they provide a very easy to use service. You cant buy russian tickets online more then 45 days prior to departure, but using <a href='http::/www.realrussia.com'>Real Russia</a> you can book and they will reserve and send ( if its not elligable for e-ticket ) when available. We used <a href='http://www.realrussia.com'>Real Russia</a> <strong>A LOT</strong> during our bookking stages of our journey and would not hesitate to use them again if needed. The train from Minsk, Belarus to St. Petersburg was pleasant and was our first taste of overnight sleeper trains, we were fortunate enough to be on our own in a 3 berth sleeper arriving at St. Petersburg at 7:15am

<h5>Warsaw</h5>
<p>
    Warsaw provided us with a nice rest night and a calm day before we headed of to Belarus, no walkking tours, no mad hiking, just a leasurly stroll around the Lazienki Krolewskie Park after finding out that the Museum of Technology next to the station was closed on Monday's, I think this is quite normal for museums to be closed on Mondays in parts of Eastern Europe. 
</p>
<p>
    having only one night in Warsaw we decided to eat out and found a resturant called -----, reading the menu outside we noticed Lasagne and Tagliatelli and thought why not, upon seating and being handed a English menu we found out that it was a hipster crepe bar. We decided to stay and glad we did, the crepes were amazing and fairly cheap for the kind of place it was. Word of warning they have a beer and wine list, all beers and wines are non-alcoholic, we went for ice tea.
</p>

<h5>Belarus</h5>
<p>
     Belarus gave us much of the same as Warsaw, very quiet day as we arrived at 10am and were leaving at 8pm we didnt have much time to do things. After our arrival we headed to the Luggage storage office, costing us around 10Bealrus Rubbles ( roughly £1 ) for the 2 bags for the day, we headed out to the nearest cafe we could find, after realising that the train to Belarus didnt have a food carrage, we were ravenous! 
</p>
<p>
    Outside the Minsk central station is a cafe called coffee palace, we kept it simple with a bowl of porridge and a coffee, but they do offer more options like eggs, bacon etc. Portion sizes were good and the price was relatively cheap considering how nice the cafe was
</p>
<p>
    After having a bite to eat we headed to the Museum of the Great Patrotic War, ticket prices were fair, around 3pound, which gave us nearly 4hours of sight seeing, we could have easily been there for double that there was 158 voice logs in total, we managed to listen to around 70 after realising the time and skipping some. We would recommend that you do get the audio guide as well, it costs about 3 pound per person and you have to leave an ID card, the speakers english is understandable, but it really pieces parts of the Museums artifacts together nicely.

<h5>Warsaw - Apart Rooms</h5>
<p>
    After sleeping in dorms since we left we decided to change our original Hostel 2 night booking to a single night booking and stay in a nicer apartment. We didnt realise just how nice it was going to be, tiled floors in the kitchen and bathrooms, great showers, very nice bedrooms, with flat screen TV, a fantastic interet connection, allowing us to watch the last episode of Taboo! The Price for this was very cheap, 15 pound for the two of us. 
</p>
<h5>Belarus - Sleeper Train</h5>
<p>
    The first of many! Our 3 bed sleeper carrage was ok, nothing stood out, but it served its purpose. We did however cross the border at midnight and then had to go through the whole Visa process, which is of course understandable. But meant that Kat and I couldnt sleep till after that process was complete, we managed a few hours kip before arriving in Minsk.
