<h3>Koh Rong Sanloem</h3>

<p> 
    After speaking to a few people, and reading some reviews online, about Koh Rong and Koh Rong Sanloem, we decided to go to the latter, the smaller, more chilled island of the two. Our bus to Sihanoukville and return boat with Speed Ferry Cambodia to the island cost $20 each, all booked at Jack’s Place. 
</p>
<p>    
    The boat left Sihanoukville at 3pm and took only 1 hour to get to Saracen Bay on the North Eastern side of Koh Rong Sanloem Island. This beach looked nice, bright white sand and clear sea, but there were lots of resorts here and the water channels into the sea looked a bit brown. So we decided to head to the more secluded ‘Sunset Beach’ on the other side of the island. 
</p>
<p> 
    We had to trek about 3km in total with our pack’s on, first up the beach, and then across the hill through the jungle to the other side. There is nothing in the middle of the island, no roads, no houses, just dense jungle and a slippery, rocky footpath. It was chucking it down too, which at first we were pleased about as we were so hot it cooled us down. However, it made the path very slippery, and on the downhill Kat slipped and cut her arm on a rock. On the way back we will definitely wear trainers, flip-flops was a bad idea!

    Feeling exhausted, we made it to the other side and as soon as we got to the beach, we dropped our packs and ran into the sea, Kat fully clothed she just wanted to wash her wound out. Looking up the beach we decided to stay at ‘Robinson’s Bungalows’. This beach is so lovely, there’s only 4 places to stay at and they’re all set back into the jungle off the beach, so it’s unspoilt golden sand and turquoise sea views from every angle. 
</p>
<p>
    Thinking we would only spend 3 nights, we ended up spending 5 nights here. It truly was paradise. We had our own little hut with a bathroom and porch 10m from the beach for $16.50 a night (it’s more normally but we did a deal as it’s off-season). The guesthouse is run by a Swiss couple and they have some locals working here and a lovely German girl volunteering (lucky her!). The food was amazing, so was the happy hour wine, and we just spent the evenings chilling in the lounge area watching the sunset, playing board games and chatting to other travellers. Lucy and Rachel also came over for one night, was great to see them again and we tried to play Uno, but couldn’t remember the rules. So ended up playing the longest game of Uno ever with ridiculously hard rules we’d created.
</p>
<p>    
    We didn’t leave Sunset Beach for the whole 5 days. It was bliss, there was no one on the beach or in the sea most of the time, just us. No internet or WiFi either here, and we spent our days ‘off the grid’ swimming and snorkelling to see the fish by the old pier, paddle boarding, sunbathing, reading, eating, chilling, sleeping and catching up on this blog!

<h4>Robinson’s Bungalows</h4>

    'Robinson’s Bungalows' was fantastic, you end up staying in a relatively cheap bungalow ($8 each a night), with only a car battery and solar panel of electircity to last, and thats fine! We ate and drank at the guesthouse for 5 days, and the total was around about $220 for the two of us, not bad considering the size of the tab!! 
</p>
<p>
    Just a word of advice, due to the guesthouse being <strong>SO</strong> remote! There is very limited electricty and absolutely no wifi. You can of course buy a sim card but even that is hit or miss depending on the network / weather!
