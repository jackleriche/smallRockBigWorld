<h3>Phnom Penh</h3>

<h4>Transport</h4>

    No more motorbike travelling, back to being bus wankers again. Our ‘Sapaco’ bus cost us 230,000 Dong (£8) each, and left Ho Chi Minh City at 11.30am and arrived at the border at 1.30pm. When we got on the bus, one of the conductors took our passports and kept it to fill in the visa forms and held onto them to pass through the borders, it cost us $35 for a 1 month visa for Cambodia, we have heard that if you do it youself its only $30, but we really didn't have an option. We then stopped for lunch before driving to Phnom Penh, arriving at around 6.30pm.

<h4>Things we did:</h4>

<p>
    Straight to sleep after we checked in and some food as we walked the 2.7km from the bus stop to our hotel with our packs on, not used to this walking thing anymore.
</p>
<p>
    The following day, we got into our first ‘Tuk Tuk’ (they don’t have them in Vietnam), which in Cambodia is a moped retrofitted to have a carriage on the back. Our driver took us to the train station, to book our train for the next day to Kampot (you can only book at the stations), then onto the Genocide Fields. It was really tough, so many awful stories and heartbreaking to see the mass graves and giant monument containing victim’s skull’s and bones. So awful that the country lost 3 million of their 8 million population due to a man with a horrifying distorted vision. 
</p>
<p> 
    We bumped into Adel there, and also Lucy and Rachel, so we planned to meet that evening for drinks and some dinner.
</p>
<p> 
    The next day, we headed to another museum of the Khmer Rouge, which was the S21 prison. It was a Prison where dreadful tortures happened and people were shackled to the ground before being sent to the ‘killing fields’. Two very heartbreaking museums, but definitely a must see to remember those who lost their lives, and for people to learn the horrible reality of what happened to try and stop it from happening again.

<h4>The Royal Inn</h4>

<p> 
    We decided to treat ourselves to our own room for once, and stayed at a place called ‘The Royal Inn’, which wasn’t as posh as it sounds. It cost us $20 per night, including breakfast, for the two of us for a big double room with a bathroom. It would be a standard 2* hotel at home, but like luxury for us now though!
