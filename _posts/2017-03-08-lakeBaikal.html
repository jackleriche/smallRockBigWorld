    Arriving in Irkutsk at midday we met our new Honcho Ksenya at the platform. We were quickly wisked away into a mini bus that took an hour to get to Listvyanka, where we were staying on the lake. 
</p>
<p>
    The roads on the way there were just awful... I guess its the sub zero temperatures and the grit they use that wear away the roads, not to mention the rework on a new main road which took us onto a beaten track for a mile or so. Put it this way even Thorp Park doesnt have rides this good.

<h4>Listvyanka</h4>

    We did alot in our two days at Lake Baikal. After arriving at our guest house, we went to the local fish market to grab some lunch. It turned out to be International Womans Day which is a public holiday in Russia. So everyone seemed to have come to the lake for the day. We tried the local smoked fish, a fresh water trout, which was delicious. 
</p>
<p>
    Later we walked to a local blacksmiths, it was a pretty fresh -10c, we tried our hands at making pendents inscibed with pagean runes. We were told what each of our chosen runes represented, but none of us remember. This cost us 700rubles (less then a tenner) each, and we got to keep the pendent as a gift. It was nice to be working by the coal fire and learn some peagan history.

    The sun was shining, the wind had dropped, could only mean one thing... SKI TIME. The local ski hill was 10 minute drive away. Costing a whopping 1100 rubles ( £16 ) for both ski/board and boots hire and half a day ski pass each. There was only 1 chair lft with 2 pistes to chose from. a windy green or a blue / red run with a mini snow park. The view from the top was pretty incredible as it overlooked the lake and where parts of the ice had melted. It was also surprisingly warm at a balmy -1c. 
</p>
<p>
    Our honcho told us about snow mobiling on the frozen 1600m deep lake, which had about a foot of snow on top due to the recent dump in the week. It was fairly pricey at 3500rubles ( £50 ) for the 1 snow mobile for an hour, but you can two up on them and share the cost, which is what we did. Out on the lake it was magnificant. We went right up to the edge of the melting ice and across to the old railway tunnels in the cliff where no one was around. Standing there in the snow on the one meter deep ice absolutely nothing but stillness and tranquillity. You can see why its nick named 'The White Desert'.

    Included in our Vodka Train tour was a free 2 hour Banya session. This is a traditional Russian suana, which was in the guest house. Our honcho had told us a little about the Sauna, mentioning that it gets up to 100 degrees, we thought she ment farenheight, we were mistaken. The Banya sauna is all about contrast, we were instructed to stay 4-5 minutes in the boiler room, even that was a tough challenge in its self, hit one another with birch tree branches, then run outside and roll in a pile of SNOW, finally warming up with a hot local herbal tea in the warm room  next to the sauna. It was definately a different experience to our budapest spa day!

<h4>Demidov's Guesthouse</h4>

<p> 
    Demidov's Guesthouse, is where we stayed in Listvyanka. It's located about 200m walk up a lane from the lake (our notes said 50m but it was definitely a bit further). It reminded us of a ski chalet, with the wooden interior and views of snowy hillsides. It was nice to have some space to unpack and re-pack after the cramped train, and sleep in a proper bed for 2 nights. 
</p>
<p>
    Breakfast was included in our stay, which we could decide what time we would like it, consisting of coffee or tea, bread, eggs, salami and tomatoes ( Jack's favourite ). We had to pay 100rubles (about £1.50) each for wifi for the 3 days, and got 1 bag of washing done for the 3 of us for 300rubles (100 each). We also had dinner there both nights, this cost 600rubles (£8) a night, which included tea, salad, bread, a traditional Russian main dish, and a macaroon each. It was really tasty and nice to just chill in the evenings at the guest house after our busy days. 
</p>
<p>
    The only 1 downside to our stay here were the showers. Each room had an individual boiler and the hot water would only last for about 2 minutes max! This meant 2 people showering was quite difficult and took water on, rinse, water off, lather, water on, rinse and water off skills!
