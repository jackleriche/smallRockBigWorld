<h3>Day 20</h3>

    After the boat tour, we had a bite for lunch and headed off on a short 60km ride to our next destination. The ride was brilliant with wonderful views of more mountains and rivers. It was to a random homestay that we had found on maps near the national park. We couldn’t actually find the homestay and asked a corn farmer who took us in to stay there, maybe it was the right place, or he just was a nice guy?!

    This area was down a dirt track, near lots of fields and farms. The farmer, ‘Minh’, cooked the 4 of us (Robert and Laura are still riding with us) an incredible dinner and gave us mats on the floor  to sleep on, with mosquito nets to put above us. Minh was so lovely too, he even gave us a couple of rice wine shots, and despite none of us really being able to communicate much his laughter and smile was wonderful. For 300,000 Dong (£10) a couple, we had a huge dinner, a bed and breakfast.

    Another big ride. We are finally on the famous Ho Chi Minh Highway, great road conditions, and even better scenary. Riding through flocks of butterflies (I know it should be swarms but that just sounds wrong for them!). The town of Tan Ky was a little strange, we couldn’t find many places to stay, or eat and the locals were a little funny with us, for the first time in Vietnam. Found an old hotel called ‘Dia Gia’ for 175,000 Dong (£6) per couple, it was very old and dated, but there were beds and showers so it did the job.

    Not a lot to report again. Up and out early, good roads, lots of Km’s, more jungle scenary and slightly burnt arms as it was another hot day riding. Stayed at ‘Trung Hieu’ motel for 150,000 D (£5) per couple. The Ho Chi Minh trail is proving to be less busy then the more popular Highway 1, which suits us as we are taking our time and soaking all the scenary in.

    Made it to Phong Nha after another breakdown and pouring rain! Troublemaker decided to throw her chain off in a tantrum. So Jack needed to keep stopping to put it back on. After the 3rd time, he grabbed the tools and tghtened the chain properly, which fixed it enough to get to a mechanic in Phong Nha. Found a home stay called ‘Hoan Chau Homestay’,

<h3>Day 24, 25 &amp; 26</h3>
<h4> </h4>

<p>
    Ah lovely dry clothes after another cold shower! Post riding in the pouring rain, we decided to head out for some food and mooch around Phong Nha village. It’s very small set between the mountains, and all the hotels, bars and restaurants are down one street. In the evening we decided to head to ‘Easy Tiger’ backpackers for a few beers to celebrate our ‘100 days travelling’ (as if we ever need an excuse for beers). Ended up bumping into some travellers we’d met before and a few beers turned to many, and even onto ‘Andy’s Disco’, when Easy Tiger shut for some cheesy 90’s/00’s tunes, pool and more beers!

    Ouch, our heads are splitting today. Very hungover from last night so it was a slow start to the day before heading out to ‘Paradise Cave’. The cave was amazing, only found in 2005 it’s apparently 33km long, but tourists can only go 1km deep without a guide. There were so many vividly coloured stalagmites and stalactites in whites, purples, reds, greys, greens and browns, it really was beautiful. 
</p>
<p>
    Our final day in Phong Nha saw us head to ‘The Dark Cave’, before we hit the road in the afternoon to move on. Kat did the cave with Robert and Laura, as Jack wasn’t feeling too good he went for a cruise around the mountains on Trouble Maker instead (he was also pissed off that he wasn’t allowed to do the zip line in as there was a weight limit of 90kg’s and he’s lost 12kg and is now 95kg but was still too heavy!). It was pretty cool, you had head torches, as the name suggests it was pitch black in there, after after Zip lining across the river, you swam to the entrance then climbed 1km, past big spiders and see-through crickets, through to a bit mud hole in the middle of the cave and had a nice cold mud bath in the pitch black! Then you clamber back, swim into the cave to see the bats before swimming out and kayaking back across the river to the start. It took about 2 hours and really was brilliant fun (sorry Jack for rubbing it in).

    Hoan Chau Homsetay, where we stayed in Phong Nha is just 50m up the road from the popular ‘Easy Tiger’ hostel. It was 250,000 Dong (£8.50 ish) per couple for a private room with a comfy bed, a bathroom. We could park the bikes out the front and price included breakfast, lovely.
