    Another Bus this time from AMSbus, taking around 4 hours and only costing 12.5Eeuros ( or £10.72 ) for the two of us! Buses are a really cheap way to travel Europe, and have saved us lots of money despite the bordem and the numb arses!  
</p>
<p>
    The bus was rammed to start, but after an hour and the first stop in Brno most of the passengers got off, giving us the whole back seat to sprawl out. The view was mainly flat with a few forests thrown in for good measure, patches of snow, frozen rivers and pleanty of rain. The Driver on the other hand was something else, we would draft lorries to an inch of collison then pull out like a mad man before cutting up the lorry he had just overtaken, causing some beeing waking Jack up from his sleep!

<h4>The wonders of Prague</h4>

    Hindsite is a bitch! had we known that Prague was going to be so beautiful with so much to do we would have missed out of Bratislava and headed straight to Prague from Budapest giving us an etra two days. We barely scratched the surface with the time we had, but managed to do a fair old amount in the one full day and 2 hours in the first night.
</p>
<p>
    We headed into the old town after arriving, to grab a bite to eat and see the hustle and bustle of the night life. Walking over the one of the four bridges we could admire the famous Charles bridge and castle behind which was lit up in the night looking like something straight from Disney. 
</p>
<p>
    Heading into the old town we had a delicous athentic Czech meal sharing the cabbage soup and sausage starter, sounds awful but was amazing, followed by Goulash (Jack) and trout (Kat). Dinner was delicous even with a glass of wine and a beer, the meal came to around 845CZ ( around £30 ), for the two of us
</p>
<p>
    Before turning in for the night we wondered into the old town square, where we seen the famous Astronomical Clock, pretty impressive, but both of us were so full from bread, soup and dumplings that we really just wanted to woddle back to our Hostel and call it a night
</p>

<p>
    The next day we woke up early and made a plan for a complete circle starting with the Prague park which leads up to the Petrinska Rozhledna viewing tower, based on the Eiffel tower it stands atop to park hill and has great views of the city. Costing 120cz ( £4 ), it is well worth a visit, even if it as just to watch Kats fear of heights kick in, especially when the tower wobbled in the wind.
</p>
<p>
    Following the Tower we headed to the Castle, built in the 1300's for Charles IV, it's an impressive gothic style building, we didnt fork out the 300cz ( £10 ) each to go in the buildings and down the golden lane, so we'll have to do it net time we visit Prague. 
</p>
<p>
    After the castle we headed to the Kafka museum, having not known who Kafka was previous to entering it was all abit confusing following that we headed to the Museum of Medevil Tourture, which houses 60 odd torture instruments, which makes your skin crawl, but luckily wasnt too scary for Kat 
</p>
<p>
    The Resturants in Prague aren't all expensive, especially across the river near the the Prague district 5, we were originally planning on cooking in the hostel but found a lovely resturant, Vidlicky A Noze Restau, that offered a large main and a drink for 441czk ( £13.83 ) for the two of us, Jacks pint and Kats wine cost £1 each!

<h4>Hostel Cortina</h4>

<p>
    The Hostel was very dated, with old decor but was clean. It was nice to have our own space in a double room, which worked out cheaper then both of us in a dorm. The price for 2 nights for 2 people came in at £30.
</p>
<p>
    couple of negative points: The beds were extremly hard, making me wonder if there was a matress on them at all and the shower pressure was awful. But for the price it was worth it as we didnt spend much time in the hostel during our stay in Prague.
