<h3>Bagan</h3>


<h4>Transport</h4>

<p>
    Myanmar's rail network is fairly limited, so buses are the main source of transportation here. Yangon to Bagan on an overnight bus with ‘Bagan Mintha’ cost us 20,000 kyat (£12) each. The bus actually left early for once, departing at 8:30pm as everyone was there.
</p>
<p>
    Kat managed to sleep, even throughout the rocking of the bus on the poor roads. They provided blankets, pillows, water, a can of coke, and a cherry cake which was nice. We arrived at Bagan by 05:30. Once off the bus you get bombarded with taxi drivers, agree a price and head to the guesthouse.

<h4>What we did:</h4>

<p>
    Bagan has an entrance fee of 25,000 kyat (£15) which lasts 5 days, this gives you entrance to the main pagoda’s. However, Robert and Laura’s (the Dutch) taxi didn't stop at the office, and so they didn't have to pay. 
</p>
<p>
    E-bikes are the way to get around the maze of Pagodas in Bagan. Costing 7,000 kyats (£4), they are a cross between a motorbike and a battery pack. I'm surprised they took my weight, they look like they could fall apart at any given pothole, but they were fun nonetheless. 
</p>    
<p>
    The idea is just to get lost in Bagan, it's a small area and houses over 5000 pagoda’s. But after seeing the main Pagoda’s and a few lesser ones you do get ‘Temple Tired’. We stumbled into a local 3 vs 3 football tournament, where the reds (wearing liverpool shirts) were facing the whites. It was a grueling match, but eventually the Red’s managed to win the match. 
</p>
<p> 
    Ate at a few hotspots, ‘wether spoons’ is a cracking little place in the new town area. Friendly staff, great food and quite cheap. 
    ‘Leo’s’ we were recommended by a cafe owner in Mawlamyine. Very cheap food, great service and the mutton curry was awesome.
    ‘Be Kind to Animals and The Moon’ was the top vegetarian restaurant, We all enjoyed the food there, even Jack.
</p>
<p> 
    ‘Mount Popa’ is located fairly close to Bagan and is well worth the visit. It's a 1 hour minibus ride to the base, however you have to do the mandatory stop at a mate of the drivers store first. The tour cost 9,000 kyats (£5) and lasted from 3pm - 7:30pm. Hilariously, we got in a shared taxi outside our guesthouse, did a u-turn, no joke literally the other side of the road, before we had to get out of the taxi and into a minibus…. Anyway the tour was great, it's not guided so you just walk yourself up the 777 steps to the Temple, and look around. A shed load of monkeys live there, which we did have to watch out for them trying to steal our water bottles, but were great to watch playing as the sun set.

<h4>Accomodation</h4>
<p>
    ‘ShweNaddi Guesthouse’ was awesome. We had a triple room, including breakfast (ridiculous amounts of food as Neil said) and they let us check in at 5:30am and have a breakfast. Central location in the new town and they have e-bike hire. Think per person it worked out around £5 a night?

<h3>Mandalay</h3>

<p>
    We took a minibus, costing 9,000 Kyats (£7) each from Bagan to Mandalay, thinking that this would be the better option compared to a bigger bus as it took us door to door. We were so wrong. The bus was completely rammed with bags everywhere, on the floor and on our laps, we had no leg room, poor Jack, and it was extremely hot, no air-con and packed. Took 6 hours in the end, and if we were to do it again, we would get a big comfy air-con bus with legroom!

<h4>What we did:</h4>
<p>
    Chilled out after arriving and then had some beers and went to watch the ‘Marionette’s’ puppeteer show. It was 1 hour long, and really good fun to watch the old fashioned puppeteering skills, the traditional music band, 2 puppeteers and a musician having a random chat (not part of the show) halfway through, and an 85 year old puppet master. It cost 15,000 Kyats (£9) each and was well worth it. 
</p>
<p>
    The next day, Jack unfortunately wasn’t too good after a very spicy curry the night before. So Lucy and I headed out on a tour organised by the hostel. We were in our own private car for the whole day, seeing different sights, for 30,000 Kyats (£18) for the car, which can take up to 4 people. 
</p>
<p>
    We did typical tourist things like: going to temples, visiting wood carving, marble carving, lunge weaving and looking at the views from golden pagodas at the top of hills. However, our favourite parts were; visiting the ‘Mahar Gandar Yone Monastery’ in the morning meeting a monk called Jamie Vardy who said we were his ‘cup of tea’ and took us around showing us the ropes of monkhood. Despite that, we still don’t know what a monk really does. He said it’s ‘easier said than is done’ but also ‘different strokes for different folks’ that he understood not everyone could be a monk for 7 years like him! Another favourite was stopping off at a free school and meeting the wonderful children on their lunch desperate to practice their English with us and put flowers in our hair, and visiting the ‘U Bein Bridge’ in the evening to watch the sunset where we also met Jamie Vardy again!
</p>
<p>
    The only part we did not enjoy so much of the tour was the couple of hours at ‘Inwa’ after lunch. They make it out to seem like it’s an island and you must take a boat to get there, then pony and cart around very bumpy lanes to see the ancient temples (2 temples you have to pay extra for). But instead it was a complete tourist trap that wasn’t an island at all, just across a small river, you get accosted every 5 minutes to buy stuff and we could have got mopeds or bicycles instead. It was also middle of the day, very hot and Lucy and I had done so much we were a little bit over it. We were glad to pay our pony and cart owner so that the pony gets well looked after though, they did all look in very good condition.
</p>
        
<h4>Accomodation</h4>
<p>
    Ace Star hostel was wonderful. We stayed in the mixed 8 bed dorm with free breakfast, A/C, shared bathroom and a mini balcony for 12,000 Kyats (£7) each a night. The staff were so friendly and helpful, there was free laundry plus free tea and coffee. It was also situated right next to the train station, amidst a few bars and cheap restaurants.
