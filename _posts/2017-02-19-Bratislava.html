<h3>Bratislava</h3>

<h4>Transport</h4>
<p>
    Tickets for the train couldnt be found or bought online using goEuro. However using InterRail we found that there was in fact a direct train from Budapest to Bratislava, but we still couldnt buy them from the website EuroCity, but could buy them directly from the train station for 10,850HUF which was about Â£30 using the Monzo card

    The train took 3 hours and was a quiet and pleasant journey

<h4>The city of Bratislava</h4>
<p>
    We ambled around the city on Sunday, which was very quiet as it was a Sunday and due to it being off-season, we also noticed many of the cafes and resturants were either closed or being refurbished. Bratislava has a very small city center which is easy to walk aroud but there isnt much going on. We decided on the Monday to do another Free Walking Tour, as we hadn't even heard of Bratislave before we got there and therefore hadnt looked to see what it offered in terms of history / activites. The walking tour started at midday from the town hall square, and lasted 3 hours. The tour guide even came out for lunch and a pint with us after. The tour itself was very interesting and informative, Slovakia has an impressive amount of history and should you find yourself in Bratislava we would highly recommend the walking tour.

    We were prepared for a new currency in Slovakia but were pleased to find out that they have used Euros since 2009, meaning for easy currency conversion and with prices similar to Slovenia

<h4>Downtown Backpackers Hostel</h4>
<p>
    I was taught if you didnt have anything nice to say not to say anything at all.... Kat on the other hand thinks the hostel was an afterthough to the resturant and pub downstairs. Very dark, dingy and there were alot of permenant residents in our dorm who seemed to stay in the room all day and all night, didnt talk to us, which made us feel uncomfortable.
