    Another travel day to get to Krakow, this time on a 7 hour Bus from Prague, using PolskiBus a new leather seated double decker which cost us 10pounds for the two of us. Cant really complain at that price even if the Wifi didnt work and Kat got numb bum
</p>
<p>
    As the bus made its way to Poland we were treated with beautiful snowy landscapes and a national park

    We were originally going to stay in Krakow for 2 nights, but had decided to change it to 3 nights on the advice of some Polish friends back home. Krakow has alot of history especially in its Medieval era as it used to be the capital of Poland. We learnt about this on another free walking tour, and the legend of the dragon as we went up to the castle. There are many free walking tours available, we used <a href='http://www.cracowfreetours.com/tours'>Krakow free tours</a>. We would highly recommend this tour as the guide was very knowledgable about her city of Krakow.
</p>
<p>
    Another good activity to do during a stay in Krakow is visit the Wieliczka salt mines, we used <a href='http://www.seekrakow.com'>SeeKrakow</a> again highly recommend as they do pick up / drop off from the Hostel and provide a plpace for you to leave baggage/luggage. The tour was fascinatinig, the mine is absolutely huge and dates back to the 1400's.
</p>
<p>
    We used <a href='http://www.seekrakow.com'>SeeKrakow</a> again to visit Auschwitz, it really is unimaginable how much hatred and inhumane the Nazi's were to the prisoners of war / Jews at the death camps. It did make us appreciate what's important in life and the people who died in the concerntration camps and those who lived and fought for freedom.

    After the haunting experience of Auschwitz we went out for a dinner and a few drinks, Krakow does not disappoint. We ate in a local resturant called <a href='http://www.gospodakoko.pl/'>gospodakoko</a> which did good local food with an extremely low price point of 40Zlotys( Â£8 ), this got us two beers, two soup starters and two large chicken and chips meals for main!! There is also a local bar downstairs in the wine cellar basement which is a recurring theme in many of the bars in Krakow
</p>
<p>
    We would also suggest eating out at <a href='http://www.bordo-krakow.pl/'>Bordo</a> again serves local food for a fairly cheap price point, they also serve English menus and have a more typical waiting service

    Having changed our original plan from 2 nights to 3, we had to place two bookings. The first room was a 10 bed dorm which was fairly decent. The beds were comfortable and the hostel provides a free locker service ( deposit required ) and breakfast ( very basic ).
</p>
<p>
    For our last night we stayed in the 6 bed dorm, which was also comfortable and had its own bathroom, but unufortunately we were lumped with some youths who came in at 3am with no regard for the quiet after 10 policy. I dont mind a quiet conversation but this was full on shouting and howling with laughter.... maybe we're getting old....
