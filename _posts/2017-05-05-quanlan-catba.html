<h4>Distance: <span>108km</span> </h4>

<p>
   It’s Kat’s birthday :D An early start off the Island of Quan Lan at 7am, then a very hot motorway drive through Ha Long city and onto another boat to Cat Ba Island. This time it was a proper ferry that we could drive the bikes onto for 180,000 Dong (£6) each (person plus motorbike). 
</p>
<p>
    The boat journey was again beautiful, going across glassy water with the giant pinnacles looming overhead. The 22km drive through Cat Ba Island from North to South was also amazing. Great new roads, which were completely empty, and amazing jungles and mountains in the giant national park there.

    We had been treated for 2 nights stay at an actual resort with a pool! It was called <a href='https://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/cat-ba-island/hotels/cat-ba-sunrise-resort/a/lod/6839b562-7def-422c-a108-7c5d54e59986/357919'>Cat Ba Sunrise Resort</a>. it was on a beautiful beach, with all inclusive breakfast, where we just chilled on the beach, by the pool and swam a lot, it was bliss.

<h3>Day 15 &amp; 16</h3>

<p>
    After 2 chill days, we went exploring. On day 3 we went up to ruins of a fort up the top of a hill, which had amazing views of Ha Long bay too. The fort didn’t have a lot of information about it there, it was only 40,000 Dong (£1.40) entry though. There was an old French cannon and we walked through a big ‘U shaped’ bomb shelter too. 
</p>

<p>
    The last day we rented kayaks and paddled through the traditional, fully functional, floating village and across the open water to ‘Monkey Island’. Our kayak was a bit rubbish, with a very flat underside so we couldn’t go straight! Managed to get to where we wanted to go though and for 200,000 Dong (£6.90) for our double kayak for the whole day it was worth it.

    The other 2 nights were spent at a motel we found which was still being built, there wasn’t even a sign outside it, so we managed to get a really cheap price of 200,000 Dong (£6.90) for 4 of us in one room for 1 night. As it was brand new, it was so clean and shiny! Don’t even know the name of it though.
