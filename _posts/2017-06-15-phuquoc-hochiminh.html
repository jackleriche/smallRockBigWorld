    Sad to leave Phu Quoc, but after 6 nights here it’s time to go back to Ho Chi Minh to sell the motorbikes. We made it to the 8.30am boat to Ha Tien with 10 minutes to spare again (classic), and the crossing was really smooth back. Once we got to Ha Tien we said farewell to Adel as she was driving to Cambodia. We had thought about joining her, but decided it was time to sell the bikes as we’d risked our lives on the roads long enough!
</p>
<p>
    The 180km drive from Phu Quoc to My An was good, the roads were in great condition and we crossed lots more bridges. We saw on maps.me that there was a ‘lotus flower farm homestay’ and thought that would be a lovely place to stay for the night so headed there...we were wrong! It ended up being an experience that’s for sure. 
</p> 
<p>
    We stopped at the first farm we saw and the man who owned the place, Tam Sen, and spoke no English, came across the stream on a rope pulled boat, which after miming a lot we realised we were to put our motorbikes on and they stayed on it overnight. The place looked so beautiful in the sunset, the season was late so most of the flowers were past it, but there were still a couple in bloom. He took us too a little hut over the walkway on stilts (the whole place was on stilts), where there was 2 hammocks and a bit of fabric to surround it. We sat on the hammocks and Kat’s broke off! We also had no idea if this was just a place to chill, or if we were actually sleeping in there, turned out it was the latter. 
</p>
<p>
    After watching the beautiful sunset, we headed to the restaurant/his living room area. Then the mosquitos flooded in. We were covered in mosquitos swarming us and biting us, they even flew up Kat’s trousers and she could count 75 bites just on her legs! Hungry, after being attacked, we mimed for some food. He ends up bringing us a whole cooked chicken, head on the lot, with no rice or vegetables, just plastic gloves, bowls and chopsticks. By this time we’re in hysterics, not knowing whether the gloves to pull the chicken apart, or pick it up whilst we gnaw on it, he must have thought we were like cavemen tearing it apart.

<p> 
    Post chicken massacre, he mimed that we take showers, we must have smelt bad. We couldn’t find any showers, only buckets of water and scoops in the toilets so we stripped off and self-bathed with that! Later, his mate turned up and they were drinking beers, cooking and eating the rest of our chicken we left in a soup. We decided to join them for beers, they were both steaming already at least 8 beers down each. Tam Sen’s mate then was trying to teach us Vietnamese, despite also not being able to speak English, by shouting words and phrases and making us repeat them, although we had no idea what they meant! 
</p>
<p> 
    Feeling very confused and tired, we went to hit the hay, still unsure where it was we were sleeping. Tam Sen had brought out a mosquito net, pillow and blanket and there was a mattress on the floor. We took all these to our little hut and tried to make it homely. The mattress absolutely stank and we barely slept all night it was so hot. We woke up at 5am and decided to watch the sunrise, pack and get out of there! Turns out we’d stolen Tam Sen’s mattress, we felt really bad as he was just asleep on the floor, but there was nothing for us to sleep on either, the hammocks were broken. He made us pay 200,000 Dong (£7) to sleep at ‘Tam Sen’s Homestay’ and 300,000 Dong (£10) for the whole chicken! 
</p>
<p>
    Definitely a night we will never forget.

    Final journey on the bikes today (sniff). Very early start, 6am and it’s already scorching, Bunh Mi for breakfast (pate baguette), then on the road again. The roads were good, just a bit dull as they were so straight and flat, and we just wanted to get to the city now. Got a few bits on the bikes fixed and oil changes done en route to the city, as it’s much cheaper and we trust the rural mechanics more.         
</p>
<p>
    Arriving in Ho Chi Minh, we decided to stay at a popular backpackers as it’s easier to sell the bikes. So we ended up at ‘Flipside Hostel’ in a 6 bed dorm for 185,000 Dong each including breakfast. What sold it to Kat was that there was a pool on the roof, more like a cold tub, but still refreshing next to a roof top bar.
</p>
<p>
    We had drinks on the roof that evening to celebrate our final leg on the bikes and surviving driving the crazy roads of Vietnam. Lucy and Rachel (from Jersey) then joined us later, and it was so nice to see friendly faces from home and catch up. Ended up being the last people sat outside a club chatting rubbish at 4.30am and getting kicked out at closing time!     
</p>
<p>
    The next day, a lovely Danish couple came to view our bike’s, we’d advertised them on the ‘Vietnam Backpacker’s Buy &amp; Sell’ page. They went off to see some other bikes that afternoon and messaged us in the evening to say they would buy our bikes! We were so happy, but sad that the following day we had to let them go. We became so attached to our bikes, I think everyone does, but we were happy Red Beast and Pegasus (Aka Troublemaker) will still be travelling the country together.
</p>
<p>
    Leaving Vietnam to get a bus to Phnom Phen Cambodia. We really are going to miss this amazing diverse country, after 9 weeks here we’ve fallen in love with it.
