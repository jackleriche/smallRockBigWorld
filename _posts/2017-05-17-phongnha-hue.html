<p>
    After lunch and the rain had stopped, we drove 140km on the western Ho Chi Minh Trail through the jungle to Long Son. We barely saw any buildings or houses or even another person on the road, it was so quiet and the road was great. Once again we drove up and down past limestone peaks, through clouds and you couldn’t see through the dense jungle on either side.

    We were so lucky to arrive in the village a little earlier than normal, around 4pm, as there was a room free for the 4 of us at ‘Duc Tuan Hotel’, 300,000 Dong (£10) for 4 of us and the only place to stay for another 150km. Two lads travelling on bikes the opposite way arrived and there was no room for them at the hotel. After dinner and a few drinks with them and some locals, we decided to let them sleep on the floor in our room between the two double beds, they jumped out the window in the morning so that the owner didn’t see!

    After Kat found her flip-flops on a random villagers feet (long story), we left Long Son to do another 150km ride onto Khe Sanh, the old American military base on the DMZ line. Drive was awesome again, more jungles, giant pinnacles in the clouds, cows lying in the roads, kids running alongside you just to shout ‘hello’, we’re really loving motorbiking through this country. 
</p>  
<p>
    As soon as we stopped, the Heaven’s opened. We found a place to stay in Khe Sanh called ‘Khanh Phuong Hotel’, 250,000 D (£8.40) per couple for a nice double room and bathroom, where there was a big biker group of about 10 middle-aged guys on KTM Duke’s. We went for dinner at the same place as them and they bought us a bottle of vodka (legends), found out it's worth 60,000dong ( £2 ).
</p>
<p>
    The next day we headed to the ‘Di Tich San Day Ta Con’ war museum in the afternoon. This was where the USA had their military base in the area and there was an old runway with a burnt-out tank, more tanks, plane wrecks, giant helicopters, a huge cargo plane, guns, shells and bunkers. It was more of a museum to see all of these, there wasn’t much information, just a little picture museum which told the story there, obviously pretty one sided with some interesting captions, to say the least.

<p>
    We left Khe Sanh early, and headed east to the coast. We had word from our friend Panch that the Vinh Moc tunnels were worth seeing as they offer a more authetic feel then the more famous Cu Chi tunnels near Ho Chi Minh City. On our journey east we passed the Dong Ha bridge, a famous battle site, that made the border between the North and South American War. Pushing on another 50km or so we made it to Vinh Moc. Entry was cheap, around 40,000dong ( £1.33 ), What the Vietnamese didnt have in weaponry, they certainly made up in ingenuity. Built duiring the war, whole villages moved underground to escape the bombings from the American troops. The tunnels were a vast network of tiny rooms and long hallways, Kat got claustraphobic and had to leave, while the rest of us pushed on. The heat inside the tunnels was almost unbearable, and by the time we had resurfaced we were sodden with sweat! 
</p>
<p>
    After we regrouped we sat in the shade for a while to dry off and rehydrate before heading off to Cua Viet. We had found a little motel by the beach on Maps.me that looked promising, 4 people in one room cost 200,000 ( £ 6.33 ). After dropping off our bags, we headed for the sea, quick dip before dinner, we headed down the road across from some resorts was a local food hall, we ate well, prawns, fish, morning glory, and rice and a beer each for the grand total of 150,000dong ( £5 ).

    It is hot on the road today, we think it’s the hottest we’ve ridden through so far. We were all melting on the bikes by only 9.30am, that we decided to make our way to the coast as soon as possible to get in the sea and just stay there instead of pushing all the way to Hoi An. Still after 3 hours/110kms on the bike we found Thuan An Peninsula. After a cool down in the sea and some lunch we decided to stop off in Hue, after finding a hostel to sleep in for 2 nights we headed out to the abandoned water park about 10km outside of Hue. We were charged 15,000d ( £0.50p ) for entry but later found out that the gates are guarded by locals who are not official, cant complain the park was good fun and we could ride our bikes around it for the most part. 
</p>
<p>
    Trouble Maker was sounding rough on our way into Hue, like someone had chucked in a couple of ball bearings in the cyclinder, after consulting with our remote mechanic ( Panch ) we had come to the conclusion that the bottom end was gone, luckily for us one of the most reputable mechanics in Vietnam, who also is in partnership with one of the leading bike rental services that operate in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City is stationed in Hue, Kim Thien Garage. We decided to take her in for another check up, they got to work straight away, quoting 800,000d ( £23 ) for a bottom end fix, realign the wheels, fix the mudguard and spray black, fix clutch and fix the indicators. Not bad, but it would take 24 hours, so another night in Hue. Kat also got her kickstand sorted and they solved the electric start issue by spraying it with wd40.
</p>
<p>
    While we waited for trouble maker to get fixed we headed to the beach again, two up on ‘red beast’. More chilling on the beach, easting at the resturants and reading, before suddenly large grey clouds came rolling in. The views from the beach were spectacular, like something out of this world. After it chucked it down for a bit we decided to take our chances and head back to the city. Picked up Trouble Maker, new gaskets, bottom end bearing, crank, 3rd gear, clutch, wheels aligned, new horn, suspension tweeked, mudguard weilded and sprayed, indicators fixed, all for 1 million dong ( £33 ) hopefully thats the end of her troubles.

    Had dinner and watched 7 years in tibet on netflix before bed.
