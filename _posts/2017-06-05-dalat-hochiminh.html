    100km of dull motorway to start, then 120km along the amazing smooth windy DT725 road up and down a mountain with waterfalls right next to us. We also found an abandoned old lookout post with amazing views on the roadside. The road then followed by 20km of riding through the jungle, down a wet, muddy dirt track full of stones and potholes. Despite Kat dropping her bike in the mud on her ankle, it was so much fun. Took an hour to get through, but worth it as we saw wild Gibbons high in the tree tops!

    We ended up in the national park on our motorbikes, the woman at the ticket office was not very happy and made us pay 160,000 Dong (£5.40) each for us and our bikes to get across the river out of the park. Happy to pay it after the great views. Across the river, we found ‘Green Bamboo Lodge’ a homestay on the river side made out of bamboo. Met some more lovely travellers, more beers and dinner before we all crashed in our 6 bed room. Not bad for 100,000 Dong (£3.30) each including breakfast! The place is so lovely too, we wished we could have stayed longer.

    The first 60km was OK, did some nice roads and then Scotty’s bike broke so had to get it fixed. This meant our last 40km into HCMC was at rush hour. Not good. The roads were so hectic full of buses, trucks, cars and bikes. The suburbs were the worst, but closer to the city there were motorbike lanes and the drive was much easier. 
</p>
<p>
    We survived and made it into the city! Only one thing for it, more celebratory drinks! We were staying in a hostel called ‘Vietnam inn - saigon’ right across from backpacker lane, with a rooftop bar and massive air conditioned dorms for 12, great aircon, we actually got too cold in the rooms. But the two free beers every night was the selling point, and the start of our celebrations. After a fill at the rooftop bar we decided to take it into the the dorm rooms, where we continued with our cheap vietnamese vodka and carry on until 4am.
</p>
<p>
    We had met up with Tom, one of Jack’s old school friends who now lives in Saigon, for lunch. He suggested burritos, these things were like door stops! Humongous things, although pricey, or at least to what we’re used to, but was good to have cheese again. We also headed to the war museum on one afternoon. It was very harrowing and hard to imagine the trauma the country went through not so long ago, and still are today with the devastating effects of ‘Agent Orange’.

    Scotty was off at midnight, so in a desperate attempt to sell his bike he was trying all the tricks of the trade to sell quick, none worked and after even trying to sell to a hostel worker from ‘hideout hostel’ which resulted in us being herded through the bar street in a awful pub crawl which we fell out of rank and made our way to the park with a bag full of beers to say our good byes and wish him a fond farewell.
</p>
<p>
    With Scotty gone, but his bike still around, it was up to us to find a buyer. Luckily the buyer found us. The price was arranged, $150 but he knew it needed work, we took the guy to a car park and taught him the way around a manual bike. After we drove back to our hostel, we handed the keys, and bid farewell to the new owner
</p>
<p>
    We weren’t quite ready to sell our bikes, and decided that we wanted to go to the south of Vietnam. Adel also had the same idea, so the 3 of us planned our route to Phu Quoc Island!
