<h4>Distance: <span>178km</span> </h4>

    We left Cat Ba town and rode a different road north to the harbour to catch a ferry to Hai Phong. On the boat, it starts heading towards another island and drops us off here! Good job we had google maps to see we had to drive through this other island to get the next ferry to the mainland. The island was so small, the locals seemed surprised to see us too.

    Horrid motorways in the stifling heat once on the mainland. Then suddenly it became really dark and the heaven’s opened. We were driving in a huge thunderstorm, which was actually refreshing from the sun. The drive took us along a good road through towns and past rivers towards Ninh Binh.

    We stayed 7km from the city, in between the mountains, at a lovely new family run hostel called ‘Bamboo Homestay’. It had a pond too out the front where Jack took Kat and Laura on a bamboo raft. 143,000Dong (£5) each for a dorm bed, breakfast, a hot and cold drink.

<h3>Day 18 &amp; 19</h3>

<p>
    The beds are so comfy in this place! We slept amazingly well :) It’s very peaceful and beautiful here. On the first day we took a drive on the bikes around the area and got caught in another thunderstorm (luckily found another coffee shop to shelter in too!). That evening we had dinner with the owner, Dsi, and his family. They cooked an amazing meal with a huge river fish that they had caught that day. We learnt to eat fish the ‘Vietnamese’ style, by rolling pieces of it with mint inside a big leaf, then dipping it in homemade garlic and chilli sauce, it was delicious.

    The following day we headed to the famous ‘Trang An’ for a very touristic boat tour. We decided to go at 9am to beat the crowds, and it was a great idea as it was nice and quiet. The river tour was great, we went along the water and through caves into secluded mountainous areas, with no buildings or noise around. The ‘Bamboo Homestay’ was a wonderful place to stay, the family were great and the homestay was clean, with soft beds and the place itself was so tranquil.
