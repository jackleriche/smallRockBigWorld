    Another overnight hard sleeper, this time a 16 hour journey direct from Xi'an to Chengdu, with 2 middle bunks at 200 Yuan each (£24). The train was of similar standard to the last one. This time no snorer's (hooray), which meant we both got a good night's sleep. 
</p>
<p>
    We left at 9pm and arrived at midday. In the morning, coming into Chengdu, we passed lots of small famers houses next to bright yellow mustard fields and soggy paddy fields, and a lot of farmers tending to their land by hand.

<h3>Stuff we did</h3>

    We like Chengdu, it's our favourite place in China so far. The traffic seems a little more organised, it seems cleaner and there's lots of trees, a great river in the middle and green spaces around. 
</p>
<p>
    There is also a lot of culture here. We visited the 'Tibetan Quarter' and 'Jin Li Street' on our first day and saw the hidden 'old China' inside the developing new city. Kat got her ears cleaned, which was a weird experience! We also saw for sale lots of monks robes, beads, tassles, gold, traditional fans and combs, leaf paintings and all sorts, the list was endless.
</p>
<p>
    The main reason we came to Chengdu was to see the Pandas! So, the second day, we took the metro out of the city to catch the free shuttle bus to the 'Giant Panda Breeding Center'. We were recommended to go early to see them at feeding time, so we go there for 9am which was the perfect time to see the pandas up and about getting their bamboo breakfasts and to watch the cubs playing. 
</p>
<p>
    We absolutely loved it and watched them for hours, eating, playing and sleeping. There are also Red Pandas at the center, and you can walk through their enclosure. They are really enquisitive and would come right up to your feet on the walkways.
</p>
<p>
    We went to 'People's Park' on our last day in Chengdu. Another hidden gem in the city, where people meet to play cards and badminton, drink tea, and dance. There were several elderly dance groups where women would practice traditional Chinese dance routines or couples dance similar to ballroom dancing and we even saw dancing and singing competitions. 
</p>
<p>
    In the middle of the park, there's a pond that you can hire boats, either motorised or paddle. So we got a paddle boat for 40 Yuan (£5) for an hour and paddled around the pond. After that, we bumped into Emma and Alex from her hostel, before being invited to a badminton hit around with some locals which was great fun. 
</p>
<p>
    That evening the girls (Emma, Alex and Kat) got a traditional Chinese massage, from the parlour near the hostel. An hour's massage cost only 60 Yuan (£7) and was seriously intense. It was a mixture between a chiropractor, osteopath, massage and being beaten up! There was clicking and twisting and thumping and pulling, and a little bit of massage. Despite feeling a little battered, Kat actually felt much better after it and her shoulders are no longer sore from her pack! 
</p>
<p>
    For food we ate more chinese dishes, the traditional 'hot pot' which was really spicy, and went to the oldest restaurant in Chengdu 'Chen's Mapo Tofu Restaurant' and had very spicy tofu, all the food is hot here! We also got a lot of people staring at us and taking photos again here. People here are fascinated by foreign tourists, and I guess we stand out like sore thumbs, as many people are much shorter than us too. We think we're starting to get used to it though.

<h4>Hostels</h4>

<p>
    Mrs Panda's Hostel, is where we stayed at. It was really cheap, £21 for the two of us for 3 nights, that's £3.50 each a night! Again the staff were wonderful and helped us visit the pandas and book onward train tickets by writing in Chinese for the ticket office. A pool table, cheap beers and breakfast and the location was great, in the city center, just off the river, right next to the metro.
